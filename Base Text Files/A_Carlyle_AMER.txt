 Shall I yet again go out to battle againji the

 THESE words are taken from the hifto- 
 ry of that war which the children of 
 Ifrael carried on againft the tribe of Benja- 
 min, on account of an enormous a£t of 
 cruelty and injufllce done to a private per- 
 fon of Ifrael, by the men of Gibeah, a town 
 of Benjamin. Compenfation for this inju- 
 ry was at firft demanded ; but it was refufed 
 with infolence. War enfued ; and the Ifrael- 
 ites were defeated in two great battles, with 
 the lofs of forty thoufand men. They had 
 confulted the Lord each time they had ta- 
 ken the field ; but, for wife reafons, only 
 known to himfelf, he fought not on their 
 fule. The children of Ifrael, afflided and 
 difmayed, and afFraid that their fins wer^—

 Difcontent with the various forms of

 vailed in their turns at home, during the 
 laft century, led many afterwards to feek 
 for more peaceful abodes in that diftant 
 region. But, whatever were the obje£ls of 
 the iirft fettlers of our American domini- 
 ons, feparation troni the government of 
 Britain was none of them ; for, to preferve 
 their connexion with their native land, 
 they went all under charters granted by 
 the fovereign of this country, with certain 
 rights to the lands where they fettled, and 
 with the grant of certain powers defined by 
 the charters, and to be adminiftered in fuch 
 manner as they prefcribe. As corpora- 
 tions, they had rights given them to make 
 bye-laws for themfelves ; and, as corpora- 
 tions derived from, and fubfifting by high- 
 er authority, they continued fubjtdl to the 
 conlroul of that authority. It is impoffible,

 . And if they, for their own intereft, an- 
 xioufly preferved their connection with 
 Britain, it was clearly her part to keep them 
 in fubjedion and dependence. For what end 
 did flie fend out colonies, but to benefit her- 
 felf, to extend her commerce and her power, 
 to increafe induftry and population, and ad- 
 vance her happinefs and profperity ? Why 
 fhould (he have nouriflied and protected 
 them in their infancy, lupplied them with 
 the neceflaries of life, and the means of 
 improvement, if fhe had not confidered 
 them as part of herfelf ? Why fhould fhe 
 have fettled them once and again, when dri- 
 ven off by the natives, and encouraged and 
 ftrengthened them at great expence of blood 
 and of treafure, if not for her own com- 
 mon benefit and theirs ? And why have 
 the colonics, for almofl two centuries, been 
 fuch favourite objedts of her legiflation?

 fpeds the colonies. Their affairs of go- 
 vornmcnt and commerce are (o thoroughly- 
 incorporated with that code, that they 
 could not be erafed from it, without al- 
 moft deftroying the whole. This of it- 
 Telf lufficiently ihews how much their inte- 
 reft and ours have been blended together, 
 and ftrongly marks their dependence on the 
 legiflature of Great Britain. 
 
 On this fubjed, indeed, till of late years, 
 there has been no difpute. The colonifts ac- 
 knowledged the authority of the King and 
 parliament, and fubmitted to them on all oc- 
 cafions. In return for their obedience, 
 they claimed the protedlion of the ftate, 
 which was given them, with every mark 
 of partiality and indulgence. And thus, 
 with all the advantage of diftant fettle- 
 ments for the improvement of their for- 
 tunes, they and their pofterity remained 
 denizens of Great Britain, with the power 
 of returning when prompted by inclination 
 or wealth, and of enjoying the moft ample 
 privileges of native fubjeds. Antient right 
 then furnifhes no ground for this revolt.

 Let us next fee if it can be juftified by- 
 recent provocation. 
 
 You all know, my brethren, the necefli- 
 ty of taxes for the fupport of the ftatc. 
 As we give up part of our natural liberty, 
 and fubmit to be reRrained by laws, that 
 our perfons and property may be fafe from 
 the criminal invafions of other men, we 
 likewife yield part of our property to fecure 
 the reft : T hat is, to pay the neceflary ex- 
 pence of government and the execution of 
 the laws ; to fupport the fupreme magiftrate 
 and his judges and officers in fuitable dig- 
 nity, and to defray the expence of fleets 
 and armies, for the common defence and 
 protedion of the whole. And, left the co- 
 vetous ihould with- hold his fliarc, the law 
 forces it out of his hoard, that the reft of 
 his fellow-citizens may not pay more than 
 their juft proportion. By the happy confti- 
 tution of our country, thefe taxes are not 
 arbitrary demands, but laid on by the re- 
 prefentatives of the people, with the confent 
 of the houfe of Lords aud the Sovereign ; fo 
 that no nation was ever fo well fecured a- 
 gainft an oppreffive or unequal taxation.

 To make it compleat, every perfon within 
 our wide extended empire fhoulJ contri- 
 bute according to his ability, otherwife the 
 burden muft tall unequally. 
 
 When the colonies were in their infant- 
 ftate, flruggling with difficulties and with 
 enemies, they were not in a condition to 
 contribute to the common charge. They 
 needed bounties and rewards for their en- 
 couragement; and accordingly they received 
 them from the parent-ftate. But afterwards, 
 as their commerce and wealth incr^afed, 
 they were fometimes diredlly taxed, as well 
 as the reft of the Britifli dominions, and 
 that as early as the times of Cromwell 
 and Charles the Second, and down to 
 the period immediately previous to the 
 difpute. Thefe taxes, indeed, were laid 
 on with a fparing hand, becaufe the co- 
 lonies had but lately emerged from infant- 
 weaknefs ; Hut the authority of the ads 
 of parliament was never difputed till now, 
 and the taxes impofed by them were p^id 
 when demanded.

 But, if there had been no exercife of this 
 right of the legiflature, prior to our own 
 days, the right muft have remained entire, 
 becaufe it is elfential to government, found- 
 ed in juftice and equity, and in the law of 
 nature ind nations. The fupreme power 
 of the ftate would, at any time, have been 
 .entitled to impofe part of the public burden 
 on our fellow-fubjeds in America, provided 
 thofe impofitions were juft and fair. For 
 I do not contend for paflive obedience 
 and non-refiftance to fupreme authority : 
 But then the only juft ground of refiftance 
 is the oppreffive, tyrannical, or unconfti- 
 tutional exercife of that authority. *

 * The colonies pretended, at the beginning of the 
 dlfpute, that it was unccnftitutional to tax them, becaufe 
 they were not reprefcnted in parliament, and a new 
 diftinftion was formed, in their behalf, between the 
 right of legiflation and that of taxation, Confuetude 
 was fufficient to obviate tliefe objedions. All the argu- 
 ments in fupport of them have, however, been again and 
 again ably refuted , and particularly of late, in a fermon 
 on allegiance, by Dr Campbell Principal of the Mari- 
 thai! College, Aberdeen. See alfo the rights of Great

 The Americans, however, do not plead 
 that they were taxed beyond their proportion 
 or ability : They abfoluteiy deny the right 
 itfelf. This dodrine is entirely new, and 
 is the undoubted offspring of their wealth 
 and power. Let us trace the fads that ap- 
 parently led them to take arms, as they rife 
 
 in their order. 
 
 After a war, undertaken, as I have faid, 
 
 entirely on account ot' the colonies, which, 
 though fuccefsful beyond our moil fanguine 
 wifhes, was cxpenfive to the enormous ex-p 
 tent of near one hundred millions ; when, to 
 leflen this grievous burden in a fmall de- 
 gree, the (late laid on them an inconfider- 
 able tax, the amount of which was to be 
 applied to their own internal government, 
 they would not fuhmit to it. Though they 
 could neither jui^iy complain of the quan- 
 tity impofedj nor of the application of 
 the tax, nor plead their inability to bear 
 it ; for their trade and riches were greatly 
 increafed ; yet tiiey wantonly refufed pay 
 ment ; and, without the leaPc provocation, 
 riotoufly dcftroyed the property of fair mer- 
 chants, to a great a:nouiit, that happened to

 be the fubjed of that taxation. Compenfa-' 
 lion was dcmancled for this great injury to 
 private proprietors, and fatibfadtion for fuch 
 a daring affront to the laws. Both were 
 haughtily refufed. 
 
 On the refufal of fatisfa^'^iun for their 
 violation of private property, and outragi- 
 ous contempt of public authority, the le- 
 giflature, equitable and lieady, cnadled laws 
 to puniih the offenders, and to enforce the 
 authority of the ftate. As it was impof- 
 fible to bring the guilty to juftice in com- 
 mon form, it became neceffary to pu- 
 nifh the community that fcreened their 
 crimes ; but the penalty was to ccafe 
 the moment they delivered up the offen- 
 ders, and made compenfatlon. But the 
 colonifts made choice of the moft violent 
 part ; they obRruded the execution of thefe 
 laws, and an armed force became neceffary, 
 as in other cafes of refiftance againil law. 
 They attack the troops in the execution of 
 their duty: Then, conlcious of the atrocious 
 nature of their offence, or rather in the 
 train of a concerted plan, tliey combine, 
 from Dan to Ikerffieba, from one extre- 
 mity of the land to another. Trufting to

 their diftance from the parent-ftate, and the 
 ilrength they had acquired under its genial 
 wings, they overturn the antient chartered 
 governments, and ere6t new ones in their 
 place. They inflame the ignorant multi- 
 tude. By ledudion, or by force, they arm 
 every man. They opprefs his Majefty's 
 loyal fubjedts, and the befi friends of the 
 conftitution, and drive them from their e- 
 Itates and poflbffions *. At laft, after \ ari-

 tedtion of our antient foes, from whom we

 profpcds of ambition : They intangle the 
 many in the mazes of fophiftry. They dig- 
 nify their own unreafonable claims, lately 
 propounded, by the name of facred rights, 
 though hoftile to the conftitution. The 
 mildeft execution of the laws, they hold to 
 be tyranny, . and juft punifhment, orfelf-dih- 
 fente, they exclaim againft as the moft bar- 
 barous murder. Though, in every reipedt, a 
 part jf our dominions, united to this go- 
 vernment and fubjedl to its laws, they af- 
 fume the language of a feparate arid inde- 
 pendent (late, and thereupon form reafons for 
 adually becoming one ; ihey rebel againft 
 lawful government, and, from the neceifary 
 confequences of their own condud, they form 
 arguments to juftiry rebellion. But thefe 
 colours are employed only to impofe on and 
 deceive the giddy multitude, who are not to be 
 driven lo arms without either real or imagi- 
 nary oppreflions. The projed is of a more 
 antient date, coeval with the century it- 
 felf, with the dawn of their wealth and pro- 
 fperity ; and, when Canada yielded to the

 idea of power and independency, and a 
 glorious republic. 
 
 It 18 their ambition, then, that has led 
 them into an unjuft and unprovoked rebellion 
 againft the patent-ftate. Let us now inquire, 
 what motives may be derived from expedi- 
 ency to engage us to yield to their claims, 
 or how far we can honourably agree to them. 
 
 From the fhort reprefentation I have 
 given of the cafe, you will obferve, that 
 this is a war merely in defence of ov.r 
 eftablifhed conftitution and government, 
 and the rights of the ftate. On our 
 part, it took its rife from a legal attempt to 
 enforce the laws, and preferve their authori- 
 ty. And, though the legiflative powers, in 
 abhorrence of civil diflention, were willing to 
 depart from their juft claims ; yet their mild 
 propofitions were rejected with difdain : 
 And we are now involved in a war, (h(3w 
 tedious, expenfive, or bloody, God only 
 knows), in defence of that conftitution 
 which was eftablifhed by the wifdom, the 
 courage, and fortitude of our forefathers,

 Under this government, we have lived 
 with more fecurity and happinefs than any 
 nation ever did. In their religion, all men 
 have enjoyed an ample toleration; in their 
 property, undifturbed fecurity ; and, in their 
 perfons, a liberty inviolate. Far fuperior to 
 the republics of antiquity, the govern- 
 ment of Britain has maintained the rights 
 of human nature, with a happy equality : 
 And, while the multitude has been an objed

 dable ambition have been opened wide 
 to talents and merit of every kind. Not

 that every argument which is ufed in behalf 
 of the revolted Americans, except what 
 arifes from their diftance alone, applies e- 
 qually ta many other parts of the Biitifh 
 empire; and the views of their adherents on 
 this fide the Atlantic extend, if not to 
 the entire deftrudlion of this happy govern- 
 ment, at leafl to fo new a model of it, as would 
 not leave one (lone upon another of the ar

 ing the colonifts in this place, by obferving, 
 that the diftance which they now alledge

 when of late they fo humbly implored our

 counlbla of prudenc(; are not always wife, 
 nor the fit ft didatcs of humanity always

 that, by one great exertion to rc-eRablifh tha

 that would be loft in the violent disjundion 
 of this mighty empire ; that, by carrying 
 on this great war with perfeverance and forti-

 After the mod: violent outrage on private 
 property, the moil haughty refufal of fatif- 
 fadlion when demanded, and the mofl: da- 
 ring refiftance to the execution of the laws, 
 they have reforted to open rebellion to juUi-

 which they deem invincible : Their iliips of

 And here, without queftion, we ought, in 
 the firft place, to confefs and lament our 
 fins, and to turn to God and our duty. 
 For, though we cannot be accufed of any 
 guilt in refpcift of the immediate occa- 
 fions or grounds of this war, yet, as they 
 lie in the order of Providence, 1 am af- 
 fraid we cannot clear ourfelves of blame. 
 
 From the beginning of the world unto 
 this day, fill has occafioned the downfall of 
 nations and of kingdoms. Infidelity and 
 irreligion, negled: of God and of his wor- 
 fhip, and the moll licentious morals, as 
 they are intimately connedled together, 
 fo have they generally preceded the de- 
 clenfion and fall of dates. And who can 
 deny, that thefe are theftgns of the times ' 
 that thefe are the ftrong features of iniqui- 
 ty which mark the prefent age? 
 
 If men retain found principles, however 
 much they may fometimes depart fro^ 
 them in pradice, being led a-way by tempta- 
 tion and the error oj the ivicked ; yet there is 
 hope that they may one day return to their du-

 nation being roufed at laft, and well con- 
 duced , we were victorious in every quar- 
 ter of the globe, and left not our enemies 
 a fmgle province or ifland that could be 
 the fubjetfl of conted. When the negocia- 
 tions for peace were entered upon, you 
 may remember how difficult it was for his 
 TvLijcRy's prudent and moderate minifters 
 to frame fuch a peace as would pleafe the 
 people ; and, after it was made, there a- 
 rofe a ftorm of violence and clamour that 
 has hardly fubfided to this day. Nothing

 quells their arms had made. Time and

 In the 2d place, Let me mention, as one 
 of the more immediate caufes of our pre- 
 fent danger^ that unbounded licentioufnefs, 
 which, for a long time, has prevailed in 
 writing and difcourfe. 
 
 The liberty of the prefs is indeed a rr.ofl: 
 facred right of Britifli freedom ; hut, like 
 all other privileges, it may be abufed, and, 
 and when it is, may be productive of the 
 moft pernicious confequences. No charac- 
 ter h '' b^en lacred enough to be fafe 
 from tht jrrent of calumny and reproach, 
 which, for fome time paft, has poured itfelf 
 upon the public ear. The moft private a- 
 fylum of domellic peace has not been fecure 
 againft that malignant poifon that glides in 
 every breath, and is fcattered about on e- 
 very page. The throne has been openly 
 attacked ; and not only have the meafures 
 of government been arraigned, as in former 
 times, but the legiflature itfelf has been ri- 
 diculed, traduced, and almolt libelled in its 
 own hearing. And what is the confequence 
 of this vile licentioufnefs ? Kas the tongue 
 of fedition, and the pen of fad'on proceed- 
 ed to fuch outrage, that they are now no 
 
 longer

 refped to the charaders of individuals ; but 
 we may reft allured, that the unbounded 
 
 freedom which has been ufed has leffened the 
 refped due to the Soveregin ; has deftroy- 
 ed that reverence in which* the legiflature 
 lliould be held ; and, while itj has overawed 
 the magiftrate in the execution of his office, 
 it has, at the fame time, impaired the dignity 
 and weakened the force of the laws them- 
 felves. We may be certain, that this ram- 
 pant licpntioufnefs has overturned all ideas 
 of fubordination, which is the bond that 
 holds men in fociety together, and prepared 
 their minds to meet, without concern, if not 
 to vvifh for, a revolution of government. 
 
 How can we otherwife account for the 
 publications that have proceeded from men 
 of gravity, of profefledly good intentions, 
 and of no mean talents * ? With what other

 remains to be tried in the hiftory of the

 to which human government was going to

 to run a career of enthufiaftic fury that 
 aftonilhed themfelves when they became 
 cool ; and ftern war is an apology for the 
 moft atrocious adtions. But, in a period en- 
 lightened like the prefent, in profound peace,

 and the mild operations of commerce, to

 Among fuch peculiar and fcafonablc blef- 
 fings, we are to rank the plentiful crop 
 which he hath bertowed on us in all corners 
 of the land ; infomuch, that we fhall have no 
 dependence on foreign nations, who might 
 have taken advantage of our necelFity. We 
 ought alfo to mark, with gratitude, the pro- 
 vidential opening of new channels of trade 
 for all our manufadtures, the demand for 
 which has increafed beyond our moft fan- 
 guine cxpedations, juil in the moment 
 when the breach with the colonies might 
 have occafioned a moll dreadful calamity. 
 Let us trace the over-ruling hand of heaven 
 too, in the prefent peaceful difpofition of 
 our. potent neighbours, who feem to atteiul 
 more to the general intereft of Europe, than 
 to yield to the dictates of national rivalihip 
 and animofity. Let us likewife obferve, with 
 pleafure and thankfulncfs, the alacrity and 
 courage of our foldiers in the caufe of their 
 country, after much infidious pains had been 
 taken to make them cool and backward in 
 the fcrvice. Let us, with the warmeft grati- 
 tude and praife, mark the ardour and fuc- 
 cefs with which they defend that antient go- 
 vernment, which the pretended fons of liberty

 It would be highly improper, it would 
 be impious indeed, to apply the oracle of 
 God in the prefent cafe, and to fay, with 
 prophetic authority. Go iip^Jor to morroiv

 No ; this I may not venture to fay. The 
 event is in the womb of providence ; and 
 the race is not always to the /ivifty nor the 
 battle to the Jlrong^ for God often counter- 
 adts the probability of fecond caufes. But 
 this 1 will fay, in oppofition to the authors 
 of feeble r.nd timid counfcls, that a righte- 
 ous caufe, and perfevering valour, joined to 
 a pious trufl in the Almighty, give the beft 
 ground to hope for fuccefs in war. 
 
 In the wars ufual in Europe, when rival 
 nations have contended with each other, 
 it has often been on points of fmall im- 
 portance, and the parties have gained no-

 thing in the end by the conteft, but the e\- 
 ercife of arms. In fuch wars the intereAs of 
 mankind in general are fafe. For that equal 
 balance which has been maintained fo long 
 in the great European republic, does not ad- 
 mit of one nation's making large encroach- 
 ments, or conquefts, on another. But, in 
 the prefent war, we are to retain, or lofe 
 forever, not our new provinces, that are 
 hardly yet a part of the (late, but our an- 
 tient colonies, that are coeval with our navi- 
 gation and -ommerce, thofe great branches 
 that are deeply engrafted into the common- 
 wealth, which have grown with our 
 growth, and cannot now be lopt off, with- 
 out hazard that the tree fhall thereby 
 perifli. An objed of fuch importance re- 
 quires national fortitude and perfeverance. 
 As Chriftians, and as men, no doubt, we 
 ought to wifh and pray for peace. Every 
 thing in the prefent cafe prompts us to fuch 
 a prayer ; but always with this condition 
 under ftood, that it be equitable and fafe. 
 How far we may hope for a retu.n of af- 
 fedion and allegiance from the prefent ge- 
 neration of colonifts, who are now in actual

 hearts of men as he pleafes, in oppofition to 
 common rules* But one thing is clear 
 and certain, that, as the fword fhould not be 
 drawn againfl the fubjedts of the ilate, 
 without the moft urgent neceffity, fo fhould 
 it not be fheathed without full fecurity and 
 fubmiflion on the part of the offenders ; 
 for a peace, on any other terms, would only 
 prove a fhort and dangerous truce, to pre- 
 pare them for a frefh revolt.

 for, on this occafion, they muft go hand in ' 
 hand together. In times of peace and tran- 
 quility, the exercife oF this duty is not al- 
 ways apparent, even in the moft faithful 
 fubjedls. They are not called upon to per- 
 form any adt of fealty ; and, being at a dif- 
 tance from the feat of government, the 
 perfonal qualities, and even the royal dig- 
 nity of the fovereign, feems to be forgotten. 
 But, v^hen difturbance or danger approach, 
 thofe principles and affedions that lay dor- 
 mant, foon awaken with the alarm, and 
 the moft zealous loyalty appears in the 
 condud of every good citizen. 
 
 Let us now fupport the throne, for it is 
 ibaken ! Let us unite in warm afFedion to 
 our King, whofe charader, like the fun, 
 ihines the brighter for the fpots with 
 which fadion and rebellion, for a whil^, 
 have endeavoured to obfcure it. And let 
 us demonftrate our patriotifm and loyalty, 
 not by loud and empty profefTions, but by 
 a meek and refpedful fpirit 10 thofe that 
 are fet over us, by our reverence for the

 Above ail, let us not luppreTs that war- 
 like ardour for which »ve have ever been 
 diftinguiihed. Without rDa<:nanimity and 
 valour, vvealth and power are precarious, 
 and wifdom and liberty but empty names. 
 To be fecure, we muft be brave. All Ame- 
 rica is now in arms; fhall we remain feeble 
 and unwarlike i* The plough and the loom 
 muft be left for t'' while, that we may not be 
 obliged to abandon them for ever. For, if 
 the Almighty does not interpofe to fubduethe 
 minds of our domeftic foes, or if we do not 
 exert our native ftrength, in vain fhall we think 
 to conquer them by foreign hands. If we 
 could, they might, perhaps, in future, learn 
 tofearthefeverityof a m after, but never again 
 would they revere the authority of a parent. 
 
 Since, then, my brethren, to yield to the 
 claims of America would be inexpedient and 
 diilionourable J fince the war is juft and ne- 
 ceflary, let us prorecute it with vigour, with 
 chcarfulnefs and perfevcrance, till the re- 
 bellious children of our brother Benjamin

 that the fame powerful arm that ftretch- 
 ed acrofs the Atlantic to fave, is not now fo 
 weak but it can punifh. Thus (hall we 
 do all in our power to preferve to pofteri- 
 ty a government, the mod favourable to 
 human nature that ever exifted, and to pro- 
 long the period of light, and liberty, andhap- 
 pinefs among mankind. : 
 
 But, while we are of neceflity at war with 
 the children of Benjamin our brother, let 
 us not forget the near relation they ftand in 
 to us ; let us not entirely extioguifli our 
 affedions to the child, becaufe he is for the 
 prefent froward and difobedient. Let us 
 bend his will, but not fubdue his fpirit. Let 
 us chaPiife him in kindnefs, not Jlay him in 
 anger. Like good King David, when his 
 fon Abfalom rebelled agaiait him. Let us 
 give our captains and our mighty men a 
 charge, that they deal gently -with the young 
 man; and, whcii he returns to his duty, let us 
 receive him with open arms. Amen.
