CHAP. Buchanan as a serpent, the second of all human 

VII.. 



^"' forgers, and the first of slanderers', had consulted 



' " Buchanan published a train of confessions — ^all spu- 
rious ; the creation ef a genius that seems to have delighted 
itself in the boldness of its own falsehoods, and to have rioted 
in the luxury of itspwn forgeries.-.-His spirit could not long 
confine itself within the bounds of harmlessness. The ser- 
pent may appear for a time playing in wanton curls uj)on the 
ground. It will soon, however, rise upon its spires, and shew 
its envenomed fangs. And Buchanan returned to his natural 
exercise of fictitious slander. — But this Leviathan of slander 
was not satisfied^wjth taking- such gentle pastime in forgery. 
He must raise a tempest for his recreation. — His malignity 
acted with all the force of a pestilential blast upon his discre- 
tion. The daring calumniator sunk into an impassioned 
idiot before it. And he stands on the pillar of infamy at 
present, for his Detection, his sonnets, and his depositions, the 
. second of all human forgers, and the first of all human slan- 
derers ; but baffled in his forgeries, and defeated in his slan- 
ders by his very rage for both." Whitaker, iii. 192-3-4. 

Such is the urbanity of this scurrilous disputant, who, in 
the preface to the first edition of his Vindication, styles 
Robertson " a disciple of the old school of slander," and in the 
Vindication itself calls him a liar repeatedly, and in the most 
explicit terms. Tor instance, to take a single volume, " The 
Doftor should in ^owf/ty have shewn that she knew of his ill- 
ness*" ii. 54. " If Dr. Robertson says true, the letters are 
the most impudent of liars. Or, if the letters are true, the 
Doctor must exchange situations with them." Id. 79. " With 
such gross disingenuity does the Doctor act concerning the 
letters. His judgment is not warped, biit his probity is cor- 
rupted." Id. 185. " He treats them as papists treat their 
ifigendsu Pfejreveres.thcm in general^s true, yet he is obliged 
by tli^ power of truth to leav6 them at one time. He is in-

even the titks prefixed, he would have perceived chap. 
that those annexed to Buchanan's Detection are, v,^^^vv/ 
'* the Confessions of John Hepburn, Young Talla, 
" Dalgleish and Powrie, upon whom was justice 
"execute the iii. of January, 1567:*'. but that 
those preserved in the Cotton library, are their 
examinations and depositions before the privy 
coi^ncil, produced and acknowledged on their 
triaj in the justiciary court. If instead of adopting 
Goodall's wretched objections, he had examined 
Anderson's general preface, or the proceedings at 
Westminster, he would have found that the lit- 
ter were the judicial examinations and depositions 
of the murderers produced to the English com- 
missioners, December 8, 1568 : but that the for. 
mer were their confessions atthe place of execution, 
to which the minutes of the privy council, Decem- 

duced by the solicitations of slander to desert them at ano* 
then" Id. 207. Of Hume he ob^rves, that " His zeal ope- 
rates with all the force of a fever tipon his brain.'* Id. 401. 
Of Robertson in another volurpe, that " Bedlam is no Bed- 
lam to him ;*' i. 278. n. ; and Knox he terms the ** son of 
violence and barbarism, the religious Sachem of religious 
Mohawks." Id. 311. To multiply instances would be to 
transcrrbe his pages ; bat these license J oiiirages^he seriously 
maintains, are as lawful in a controversy concerning Mary, as 
blows and wounds are in civil wars. Id. pref. xv. His po- 
liteness towards Macpherson,whom he had really convifted of 
misquotation and forgery, forms, as I have elsewhere observ- 
• ed, such a signal contrast to his scurrilous abuse of Hume and 
Robertson, as can admit only of one explanation, that Whita- 
ker concurred with Macpherson in the authentic itr of Osiian.

" Hay, upon the scaffold at Edinburgh ^." Had 
he candidly examined the confessions themselves, 
the least reflexion might have convinced him, that 
those annexed to Buchanan's Detection, are a 
summary or imperfeft abstract, not from the ju- 
dicial depositions produced on the 8th, but from 
the confessions exhibited at Westminster on the 
7th, 10th, 1 2th, or i3th% of which the minutes 
arc lost, with every other paper transmitted to the 
press. The confessions are filled as usual with re- 
^ligious refleftions on the ways of Providence, the 
justice of their punishment, the assurance of mer- 
cy, the calls to repentance ; none of which occur 
in the judicial depositions. •' John (Hepburn) of

Buchanan accordingly appeals for the proof of a

booth of Edinburgh, the building vin which the parliament 
was held, the privy council assembled, and the lords of ses- 
sion convened, for the trial of civil or criminal causes. In 
this structure Bothwell was tried, for the murder of the kingl 
In this his followers were equally tried. In this the rebel 
lords assembled for business. And in this therefore iiould their 
previous examination of Both well's followers be made.*' 
Whitaker, iii. 191. In this sorte, to prove that the confes- 
sions and depositions must be identical, because they were 
both taken in the same building, the author forgets only the ^' 
proper use of the tolbooth, as a jail, in which the murderers 
were imprisoned, before their execution.

the adjoining back door of the noted chambers of Ormond'i

pay force by force, Mary and her confidant, Margaret Car-

their trial before the justice depute. Sir Thomas 
Craig ^. From these depositions, which coincide 
in the most minute ci^cumstanceSs we obtain adis- 
'mt^ao^*' tinct and particular account of the murder. The 
count of gunpowder which Bothwell had probably ordered 
<icr. on his journey to Whittingham, had been brought 
on Tuesday or Wednesday from Dunbar. On 
Thursday he intimated to Hepburn an enterprise 
devised by some 6f the nobility, and himself 
among the rest, to assassinate the king,' (and to 
send two servants each for the purpose) either in 
the fields, or in whatsoever place an opportunity 
could be found* On Friday morning he iiiforiiK^d 
Hay and Or mis ton separately of the de«^n ; and at 
a general consultation inthe evening, heabandoiieA 
his plan of assassination in the fields, which might 
be known or traced, and explained in what man- 
ner it might be effected better by means of gun- 
powder. The gunpowder was brought by Hep- 
burn to Both well's lodgings in the abbey , on Sa- 
turday evening, but the murder was prevented 
that night, as the conspirators were not fully pre-

But of those wiiters, to whose distempered ima- 
gination all is forgery, it is. the- peculiar misfor- 
tune, that their -assertions ai^ strong and vehe- 
ment in proportion as tteur arguments are weak 
and inconclusive. To them it is incredible that 
men, without apparent necessity, should confess 
facts to the destruction of their own lives ; as if 
the records of council and justidary were not 
filled with instances of similar confessions, or as if 
judicial confessions were never made at all. It is in*- 
credible that diifcrent persons, at distant interval^ 
should employ the same words and combinations, 
in their narratives ; as if in any subsequent evi- 
dence concerning the same faflt, the same words 
were not often dictated by the same commissioner, 
or reqorded by the clerk, from the first deposition 
which they hold in their hands. It is incredible 
that men should know each other, when they met 
in the dark, or distinguifh their doaths and slip- 
pers at midnight, soon after the change of the 
moon ; as if it were possible not to discern the per- 
sons, the garb, or the disguise of those who met 
within the Blacktriars gate, with a Kghted capdle^ 
at ten at night ". But we are told that Dalgleisl»

vn. ' 

' c^vnj inattention or stupidity, in his^ first deposition ; 

that the gunpowder had been brought on two 
horses, instead of two carriages on the same horse; 
but a forger, to whom it was indifferent whether 
the powder had been brought on two horses at 
once, or on one horse twice, would have render-^ 
cd his first fabrication complete. According to 
the first deposition, Powrie and Wilson were met 
at the Blackfriars gate by Bothwell, accompanied 
by Hob Ormiston, Paris, and two others, with 
cloaks about their feces ; according to his second 
examination, when they brought the last carriage 
to the Blackfriars gate, Bothwell came to them 
with three more, ** quhilk had thayr cloaks and 
" nmils oipon their feet *^." Here, instead of a 
slight contradiction, the two passages refer to 
the different carriages and arrivals of the powder, 
which Bothwell, walking up and down the Cow- 
gate, met each time at the Blackfriars gate. In 
Powrie's deposition the powder in the trunk and 
mail was contained in pokes or small sacks ; in 
Hay and Hepburn's, the trunk at least was emptied 

after a secret journey to Whittingham, met her again on the 
road frox^i^Glasgow, had no horses of his own in to^'n. 
The mistake was probably committed by the clerk, and dis- 
CQtered on the examination of the centinels and others, of 
whose depositions one was read to Powrie on his second ex- 
amination. .

Powrie was sent to the Cowgate to purch^tse can- i>v->/

the sacks in the interval, before his return. But 
to those conversant with legal practice, nothing 
can authenticate the depositions more strongly 
than a second examination, to correct the mistake 
of the twd horses, some month's before the evi-

Both well should change his cloaths, or why he should return 
at all, or with so many attendants, when he had left two men

THE MURDER OF DARNLEY. 17 

Buchanan refers in his Detection, arid adheres in ^^^' 
his History, to the judicial depositions, that the 
gunpowder was lodged that evening in the lower 
chamber, to which the conspirators had false keys ; 
but Wilson repeats, in his j4cfio contra Marianiy 
the tales extracted from Lesly and his servants, 
who received, and who had an interest to propa- 
gate, the queen*s account^^. At the distance of four- 
teen, and of twenty years, the hyperbolical lan- 
guage of Scottish indictments, is no evidence of 
an historical fact ; and in the indictments against 
Morton and Douglas, it was necessary then, for 
the exculpation of Mary, to dispose of the powder, 
not in mines,but indefinitely under the ground and 
angular, or corner stones, and within the vaults, 
in low and concealed places, they knew not where. 
Two horse loads, or a single cask of gunpow- 
der, were sufficient, not according to the modern 
fiction, to blow up the foundations, but to demolish 
a ruinous house to the grundstane. But the sup- 
position of a mine implies that the expansive force 
of the explosion acts not equally in every direction; 
as if it were possible, from the ground apartment, 
to blow up the rafters, floors, and roof of an old 
house, rent and ruinous, without demolishing the 
walls. The fact is, that there was neither time 
nor room to construct a mine. There was no 
time, as the mine for which six days are allowed,

As tl;ie operation of gunpowder is better under- chap: 
stood, it is now admitted, that their bodies, from 
the intervention of the floor and bedding, were 
thrown out untouched by the explosion, and that, 
if they had fallen on the water, their lives might 
have been preserved ^\ When the murderers 
were particularly interrogated, their depositions, 
and confessions concurred in the fact, " that the 
king was handlit by na man's hands j" but the 

the archbishop's servants to have murdered the k'ngi and 
Both well' s,^/fl/o stgnof to have blown up the house. Goodall by 
dint of false translation, " Archiepiscopus libenter trucidandx 
regis, partes sibi oblatas suscepit ," tkci he *willmgly undertook ihr 
employment J represents the two passages as inconsistent, in order 
to extract a wretched argument for Bjth well's vindication ; as if 
Buchanan had transferred the whole employment, instead of 
^Q partes sibi oilatas^ to the archbishop. Buchanan's informa- 
tion is confirmed by Crawford's MS. which Spottiswbod, 
from different passages, seems to have coirdited; that Rc- 
bertson, a priest, was confronted with the archbishop, before 
his (the archbishop's) exec^tion, and affirnied that Black 
John Hamilton, oi>eof the archbishop's servants, confessed at 
his death, that he was present at the murder by his master's 
orders ; to which the latter replied, that ** he synit deadly to 
lay it upoun him quha knew nathing of the matter, 2s also he 
synit to reveal any confessioun." The archbishop, was un- 
doubtedly privy to the murder, and seems to have watched 
with his servants at; Hamilton house, till t^e explosion, took 
place; but Buchanan's inference is erroneous, that the arch- 
bishop's servants were emplt)yed to strangle Darnlcy, and 
Both well's servants to blow up the house.

Such defective intelligence could not well be trans- 
mitted from Scotland, that twelve or fifteen of 
Bothwell's principal servants had been taken in 
Orkney and executed in prison; instead of four exe- 
cuted in public, of whom Hepburn alone had been 
taken by Grange and thfe bishop of Orkney, on 
board of one of Bothwell's ships in Shetland. Lord 
Robert was not created earl of Orkney till 1581, 
but it was secretly understood that Morton was 
privy, and Balfour and Lethington accessary to 
the murder, and the queen's innocence was a ne- 
cessary addition, in a letter to the cardinal of Lor- 
rain her uncle. The fact was afterwards improved 
by Lesly, into a public confession, uttered in the 
presence of many thousands at the place of execu- 
tion. In the Instructions from the lords and abbots 
of her party, he presumes that Mary never would 
have consented to the murder, having other likely 
means of divorce or a sentence of death, to be quit 
of her husband, *' by the lords own device at

Such declamatory invectives addressed to nd

adopt, as a rule of judgment, every assertion 
which Mary's early apologists have chosen to ad-

have endeavoured to prove. But the rhetorical 
intimation of what was full well known, implies 
that it was not known : what they could tell sig- 
nifies in, plain language what could not be told;

Murray's death happened on the 2kJd of January, 1569 — ^70. 
Tytler, i. 297. By this double supputation the fact is dis- 
guised, that the end of the year 1569 was March 25th, 1570, 
according to our present coxnputation of tiire. Murray was 
s^ot, as Goodall expresses his assassination, on the 22d of Ja-

ray whom Belongs letter acquits, and whom (^hap. 
Lesly has not ventured to accuse or even to name. 
Morton and his associates were then residing as 
exiles in England ; and the intimation that they 
were actually present at the conference at Craig- 
millar, was a fiction of which Lesly himself was 
conscious, and which he wished to insinuate, but 
was afraid to assert directly as a fact. When 
branded with such notorious marks of misrepre- 
sentation and fiction, his assertion, that the crimi- 
nals confessed It their execution in the presence of 
many thousands, that the queen was innocent, 
and that her accusers were the chief authors of the 
murder, must be supported by better authority 
than his own word. The confession of what 
Both well told his servants would amount to no- 
thing if genuine, as it was his policy as well as the 
queen's, to transfer the imputation of the crime to 
Murray. But the fact inserted in Lesly's instruc- 
tions, and suppressed at the conference, was intro- 
duced into an anonymous pamphlet with the less 
hesitation ; and it admits of this obvious confu- 
tation, that the confessions ascribed to the crimi- 
nals in the presence of thousands, at the place of 
execution, were unknown in Scotland, and ar^ 
not once mentioned by a single historian of the 
age. Not to insist on Buchanan's silence, Melvil

internal marks of authenticity are indisputable ; 
as it is delivered with an arch simplicity that

b\it Paris, who studied to suppress the queen's con- 
cern in the deed, has betrayed inadvertently a sin- 
gle circumstance decisive of her guilt. On her re- 
turn to the abbey on Saturday, Margaret Garwood, 
her confidential servant, desired Paris to bring 
the coverlet of the queen's bed,which was probably 
valuable, from the Kirk of Field ; and when she 
supped on Sunday with the bishop of Argyle, she 
asked him herself if the coverlet was removed.

the one be genuine, the other cannot be less au- 
thentic* Nothing in fact can be more natural or 
regular, than the whole procedure. As the first 
is a voluntary confession, delivered without inter- 
» rogation or constraint, the second is a declaration 
in answer to certain interrogatories, on those cir- 
V cumstances which he had endeavoured at first to 
conceal. To the first interrogatory, quand premier*^ 
meni it entra en credit avec la Royiie^ he replied, that 
it was at Callender, on her journey to Glasgow, 
when she gave him a purse of three or four hun- 
dred crowns to carry to Bothwell; which has 
' furnished those persons who are ignorant of the 
'language, or inattentive to the context, with a new 
objection ; that she should give him a purse to

was in consequence of this information alone, that 
Balfour and Lethington were accused and arrest-

enchantments employed by Bothwell, which have 
won many a heart as sage and obdurate as 
Mary's ; but the pretext of magick, which the for*

was any enquiry attempted in Denmarks where 
they knew that no confirmation was to be o|^aia*r

ConciutjoiL At the close of thi^ long aiid iliinute itivestiga* 
tion, it is unnecessai*y to recapitulate our formct 
arguments, as each of the seven chajrters to which 
the controversy is reduced, afibrds the same con- 
dusioii concerning the queen's guilt. Her seact 
participation in the murdct of her husband, has 
been deduced so clearly frottl historical facts, and 
so firmly established by direct evidence, that it 
may appear surprising perhaps, ho^ such st contro* 
versy should have briginated at first, ot have sub* 
sisted so long. The fate of Peter or of Paul, ex* 
dtes no dispute ; and mankind have witiiessed the 
repetition of those crimes that are imputed to 
Mary, with open indifference or with secret ap- 
probation. But the reformation had diffused a 
more stern and InflexiWe morality through Eu« 
tope; and though the Scots had been lotig ad* 
dieted to assassination, to which the age itself was 
sufficiently inured, it is impossible, unless we pe- 
ruse the State papers and histories of the period, 
to conceive with what execration and horror, 
Mary's adulterous marriage with the murderer of 
her husband, was viewed by the reformers, both 
at home and'^broad, as the corisutamation of her 
crimes. H^d she been content to retail! Bothwdl 
as her lover and her minister, whom she might 
discard at pleasure, she might have reigned with 
impunity, and no doubt of her guilt would have

now remained. When in consequence, however,- chap. 
of her flagitious nuptials, she had been driven 
from her throne and paternal kingdom, a large 
party, religious and political, became interested in 
her vindication, and would have excused her 
crimes, had she continued to reign. The papists 
in England had no hopes but from her succession 
to Elizabeth ; her friends in Scotland were in- 
volved either in her crimes or in her misfortunes; , 
and in both kingdoms, a declining party, whose 
existence depended on her preservation ^s their 
leader, grasped with eager creduUty at the most 
outrageous fictions to conceal her guilt. But the 
interest which her sufferings, and long captivity, 
had excited through Europe, was confirmed on^ 
her death by the unexampled trial and execution 
of a sovereign prince ; and the innocence of the 
martyred queen became thenceforward an article, 
both of religious, and of political belief. Upon 
the accession of her son to the throne of England, 
the vindication of her character was recommended 
as the established doctrine at court ; and during 
the struggks that ended in the expulsion of the 
Stuarts, the guilt or the innocence of Mary was 
adopted respectively, by opposite faction?, as their 
first political badge of distinction. When the 
controversy began to be more accurately examin- 
ed, and more distinctly understood, the Jacobitejj 
continued faithful in adversity to their ancient

theme appropriated to tragedy and romance j ^ndk 
her vindication consists entirely of popular argu-

clamation, fiction, invective, ribaldry, and the 
grossest abuse. But the sober voice of impartial 
history, from Thuanus to Hume and Robertson, 
has deduced her guilt from the moral evidence 
which her conduct affords, and from a calm ancj 
accurate investigation of facts. The present Pis^ 
sertation was undertaken to vindicate the conclu-

troduce some final certainty into a question lon^

THE revival of the archbishop's comistdrial juriscUctJdrf 
is denied by Whiuker> who maintains pertinac^usfy, that 
it had subsisted from before the reformation without the 
least interruption. As Bothwell's divorce Was the con-* 
sequence of this revived jurisdiction^ and the sole instance 
in which it was exerted^ it became the more necessary to 
deny the fact ; but the evidence to which this. writer appeal 
for his assertions, seldom fails to establish the very reverse* 
The jurisdiction of the spiritual courts was abolished, and 
the causes were transferred to the civil judge, by the parlia* 
inent 1560, before the arrival of Mary, who made no attempt 
to oppose the acts passed by the J>rotestants with whom she 
temporized* " Item thair is certain statutes and ordonan^

then, with a concurrent jurisdiction, when the commissary

cent party permitted to marry again. But if the offender 
should be foolishly spared by the civil sword, and on fruits 
of repentance, reconciled to the church, then, on urgent ne- 
cessity, for fear of further offence, he might use the remedy 
{of marriage) ordained by God, First Book of Discipline ; 
Marriage. In conformity with these doctrines, the assem-f 
bly of 1562, 'applied to the privy council to transfer actions 
pf divorce to the churcE and its sessions, or else to establish 
judges of good repute (the commissaries) to decide such 
questions ; and an appeal was made to the assembly 
1563, from the bishop of Orkney^s sentence in a cause of 
divorce. Keitji, 5 1 5r24. The sentence undoubtedly pre- 
ceded the reformation, as the next question before the 
assembly was the reversal of Hamilton the martyr's sen- 
tence in 1532 ; and the bishop of Orkney, ^ protestant, 
far from possessing a consjstorial jurisdiction, had already ob- 
tained for a year, a commission as superintendent, from the 
same assembly to which the appeal was macje. The new 
doctrine of divorce was not yet recognized by the civil 
judges, arid the example merely proves, that before the 
appointment of commiss;iries, the assembly assumed the re- 
view of questions decided formerly in the conslstorial courts. 
The othjer example is not mpre to the purpose. A pa- 
per published by Tytler, (ii. 401.) containing a proof of 
the consanguinity bjstween Bo^hwell and his c ousin, lady 
Jane Gordon, is assumed by Whitaker (iii. 517) as a 
judicial act of the cqnsistorial court. It is dated February 
2^> 1555, the day before their marriage ; and is, evidently, 
an extrajudicial attestatiqn of propinquity, as; the first step 
towards a dispensation, " in the quhilk dispensation passit 
between them, sic jwocess was usit." The proof was taken, 
pot in con§istp^ry, but in the chamber of the commendator

blushing strong upon his brow ;" (Whitaker, iii, 5 1 8*2:0-1 ) 
becaij^e a signature still extant, and on record, is mentioned 
with its consequences, in an addition to his history by 
another hand- The church of Scotland itself, is accused of 
forgery, because its records contain a supplication against 
the sigiiature ; and CalderwQod, because he quotes a letter 
from Knox, to recomn^end the supplication. Such gross 
inistakes, to say nothing worse of the author, in the literary 
history of the period he treats of, are hardly exceeded by 
fhose of some wretched antijacobin, or Scotch encyclopedist,, 
who creates two John Knox's, one the reformer, the other

was deemed dercjgatory to Francis and Mary ; but Elizabeth 
could not desert her allies, nor could the French troops be 
withdrawn from Leith, where they were straitly besieged^ 
or preserved without a treaty, in which the Scots were 
included. It was concerted therefore, that the articles or 
demands of the congregation should be granted, not as 
terms of peace, but as concessions of special indulgence, 
c<mfirmed, however, in the treaty with England, and a new- 
commission was necessary, to enable the Fraich deputies to 
grant concessions, or in plain language, to treat with the 
Scots. The first commission to Monluc and Randen, at 
Chenonceau, May the 2d, 1 560, was accordingly transcribed 
in a new commission to the same deputies, dated Remoren- 
tin, June the 2d, to transport themselves, in the same terms 
with their former commission, to the frontiers of Scotland, 
to treat with the English commissioners for peace ; with 
additional powers ** to assure our subjects of Scotland, 
that notwithstanding their grievous crime of rebellion, 
if they return to their obedience, we shall receive them 
into favour, desirous of nothing more than to see them 
Kving under our obedience in repose, union, and tran- 
quillity 5 and generally to execute all that we could, if 
present in person, although circumstances should occur, 
which might require a more special mandate than this 
commission." Keith, 144, translated from Caligula, b. ix. 
fol. 126, Cotton Lib. The commission is dated the first 
and sixteenth, instead of the eighteenth, years of their 
reign, and this is a positive demonstration of forgery;

date of Mary's reign in Scotland, were not ipore likely tQ

mitted without stipulations for their citil and religious dc-* 
mands. But tiie concessions made to the Scots in the

from the temper and demands of the congregation, a new 
commission was obviously necessary to treat with the

** For so the world shall say that he (Francis) is forced by 
your majesty thereto, (as in truth he is, although it may 
not be said so to Frenchmen) next the Scots shall hereby 
. owe all the favour which they receive from their king or 
queen to your majesty, as in truth they do, though it may 
not be said so to the French ; and to make a cover for all 
this, these ambassadors were content to take a few good 
^ words in a preface to the same article, and we content widi 

the kernel, yielded to them the shell." id. 352. In his 
letter of the 8th, he recapitulates the principal heads in the 
accord of Scotland, precisely as they are contained in the 
treaty in queftion ; and as the supposed forgery must have 
been of the same date with the real treaty contracted with 
England, no man in his senses can beUeve for a moment, 
that Cecil would connive at the one, while conducting the 
other ; and that for the sole purpose of deceiving Ehzabeth, 
and her allies the Scots. Whitaker, iii. 493. 

But the conditions of accord with Scotland, are confirmed 
by an article of the treaty with England, with a preface 
exactly as explained by Cecil, to prevent the apparent dis- 
honour of the; king and queen of France. ** Seeing the 
most christian king and queen have granted their assent to 
certain supplicatory petitions presented by the nobility and 
people of Scotland, and being desirous to have their said 
benignity attributed to the good offices of the said Eliza- 
beth, &c. Therefore it is agreed before the said com- 
missioners of both parties, that they shall fulfill all those 
things which by their said commissioners they have granted 
to the said nobility and people of Scotland at Edinburgh

things that are contained in the laid articles and convention 
to be performed on their part." Keith, 135. The supplv^ 
catory petitiohs can relate to nothing else than the complaints 
and demands of the congregation, which,- in eVery treaty 
with the sovereign, must assume the form of supplication 1 
pU those things which their commissioners had granted 
at Edinburgh on the 6th of July, or which are contained 
in the said articles and conventions, must relate to some- 
thing more than a general pardon, as Whitaker ^tppipses; 
(iii. 469.) on the one part, on condition of obedience ori 
the other, concerning which the preamble was unnecessary 
as 9 salvo for their honour, in a treaty with Elizabeth ; and 
the said articles and conventions are evidently all those things 
granted in the concessions, or treaty with the congregation,* 
of the 6th ef June, by the three first articles of i^Hich, ori 
the complaints and petitions of the nobility and people, the 
Frendi troops were actually withdrawn, the fortificationsf 
of Leith were demolished, and Dunbar was restored to 
the Scottish estates. 

If additional proofs are necessary, the fdurtli article peti- 
tions for, and obtains i parliament to be held on the loth 
of Jalyi to \^ adjourned till August loth, that the French 
deputies might procure an intermediate ratification froiit 
the king and queen ^ the fifth article provides that peace 
and war should be determined as formerly, by the advice 
of the estates ; the sixth that tihe privy council should be 
appointed by the queen arid the estates, out of twenty-four 
persons, whom the next parliament,- in terms of the treaty, / 

chose and transmitted their names to the queen (Keith, 
; 752. Append. 91.); the seventh, that no foreigners should 
be admitted to oflice ; the eighth, that an act of oblivionf -

As the French deputies dedined to interfere, the parlia-

when its acts were transmitted to the queen to be ratified, 
|Keith, 193. Appendi. 91.} the objection was obTioas, and 
imavoidable if true, that the treaty by which it was held^was 
a forgery. The act of oblivion passed in this pariiamcnt 
was renewed by Mary in 1563, at the intercession of the 
nobility, not as a part of the tineaty which she was deter- 
mined never to ratify 5 (Spottiswood, 1S8.) but the authors 
of a forged treaty would ndtber have ^plied to the <pmi

proclamation, that if they fail to appear, the persons named

his letters to Mafy ; but his last letter naming those men* 
tioned in the tickets whom he greatly suspected, requiring 
greater deliberation, was written anew : his acknowledg- 
ment for the wardship of Lennox, was omitted : the whole 
requisition was materially altered ; and he retained the first 
draught, which he produced at Westminster, while the 
letter actually sent, to which alone the queen's answer re- 
fers, was produced in the justiciary court, and inserted in 
the trial. Had W|iitaker consulted the MS» in the Cotton 
Library, or considered to which of the two copies Mary's 
tetter IS an answer, he would have found an easy solution 
of the forgery ascribed to that wretch Buchanan.

with the mills advocation of kirks, &c. Whereby, says 
Murray, the said Earl has gratified us greatumly,'and made 
us sure of the lands of Strathnarne and Cullard, and 
others lands; therefore he, Murray, obliges himself to set 
forward the reduction of the forfeiture to the uttermost 
of his power by himself and others whom he might pro- 
cure, and to resign the Sheriffship and Castle of Inverness 
with diverse lands allowed for keeping that Castle and 
other things, but all of them natural consequences of tbe 
reduction of the forfeiture,^ Goodall. 



The reader, in order to understand these deeds^ must 
observe, that James Ogilvie of Findlater had been disinhe- 
rited by his father, whose second wife (of the Huntley 
family) had persuaded him to entail his estates of Finlater, 
Deskford, Sec. upon his son in law John Gordon, Hunt- 
ley's brother, and on his failure, upon Adam Gordon his 
younger brother. On the execution and forfeiture of 
John Gordon in 1562, the estate was restored by Murray 
to James Ogilvie in exchange for the lands of Strathnaira 
and Cardell. Upon Huntley's return to favour, his brother 
Adam claimed the estate of Finlater, &c. which, to gratify 
both parties, was awarded to Ogilvie, and the lands of 
Auchendown and Kethmore, to Adam Gordon, by the 
arbitration of Bothwell and Lethington, the <pieen being 
umpire, on the 22d of March, the day after Bothwell obtain- 
ed the Castle of Edinburgh. Crawford's Notes on Bucha- 
nan, 160. Douglas Peerage, 262. Huntley therefore exacts 
a bond from Murray, the day before his departure, to pro- 
mote, or in other words, not to oppose his restitution, and 
the day before the act is passed, he engages to warrant 
Murray's transactions respecting the forfeited estatcj. 
Huntley's ratification of the decreet arbitral, is stated, h

Murray's bond, as the consideration for*which the latter en-

only on the restitution of the Gordons. But in Hunt-

for his restitution, is artfully stated as the consideration for

No. IX. Vol. I. Page 80. 

MELVIL^s error concerning the bondf, may be easily 
explained. None but peers were present at Ainstcj's sup- 
per, as tlie entertainment was termed, arid the bond was 
neither signed by the abbots, by the officers of state, 
nor by the burgesses, that sat in parliament. When the 
bond was again produced upon the eve of the marriage, 
Melvil was required, but refused to sign it ; (Mem, 
Pref.) and afterwards when he wrote his Memoirs, he 
would naturally imagine, that the signatures of the no- 
bility were not obtained till then. Guthrie suspects that 
MelviU's Memoirs were interpolated or altered by the edi- 
tor ; a conjecture which, after every enquiry, I can discover 
po MS. to confirm or to confute. They were first pub^ 
lished in 1683, by George Scott of Pitlochie, Sir John 
Scott of Scotstarvets younger son, by Melvil's grand-daugh- 
ter 5 and though he has certainly altered and modernised 
the language, no interpolations can be traced to other wri- 
ters, as jn Crawford's Memoirs. From the period at which 
they were published, 1683, any alterations must have con- 
sisted in the omission of unfavourable, or the insertion of 
favourable circumstances for Mary, to whom the author, or 
editor, is partial throughout. In this view, " seeing that he 
had ravished her, and lain with her against her will,** ex- 
hibits, in the last clause, the editor's comment on the Scot- 
tish rape or abduction of her person, which Spottiswood 
treats as a mere pretext, 202. 

That Melvil was a traitor because his father was executed 
in 1548, for his correspondence with his son in England j 
because he was recommended in 1559, by Throckmortou 
to Cecil •, or because he says in his Memoirs, tliat Rokesby, 
a spy, was introduced in i^66 to the queen } whereat

APPENDIX. lO^f 

Rokesby says, that his introductory letter was delivered to 
Melvil, who was persuaded that he was one of her English 
partizans ; is a conclusion worthy of Goodall himself. , 
Melvirs account is confirmed by Randolph, that Rokes* 
by's practices were so managed by Andrew Kerr, and the 
bishop of Ross, whose name Whitaker (ii. 481) tenderly 
omits, that they cannot be discovered. Keith, Appendix, 
J 69. Rokesby was not then engaged as a spy by C^cil ; 
(Haynes, 445) and it appears that Lesly was his patron at 
court. But Rokesby testifies even then to Bothweirs influ- 
ence, *^ whom I might well perceive to be in more seciet 
favour with her than any other." Id. 447. This was in 
the interval between the murder of Rizio> and the birth of 
James.

THE only remaining objection to this conclusion is the 
answer of some of the lords to Throckmorton^ in absence 
of the rest : ** How horribly the king her husband was 
Oiurdered ? What form of justice had been kept for pu- 
nishing thereof, or rather how scornfully a disguised mask 
was set up instead of justice ; how shamefully the queen 
pur sovereign was led captive, and by fear, force, and (as 
by many conjectures may well be suspected) other extraor- 
dinary and more unlawful means compelled to become bed 
fellow to another wife's husband, and ^o hiiQ iirhp not 
thr^ i^ionths b^Qre had in his bed most cru^ly murdered 
her husband, — and found such hap in an unhappy enter- 
prise that by the inu;r*d«r pf the babe's fether, he purchased 
a pretended nwyriag^ of the mother." Keith, 417. •* Other 
extraordinary and su)re unlawjful n^ns," refer, says Stuart^ 
to amatorious potions (i. 376,) »ay$ Whitaker, (iii. 1x7.) to 
stupifying draughts, wl|iGh Loyelace actually uses in Richard* 
son's Clarissa* But th^ fear, force, and the conjecture of 
other more unlawful means, refer to the marriage, not to 
the supposed rape, as they '^ compelled her to become bed^ 
fellow to another wife's husband j" a homely expression, 
by which the lords, unwilling to acknowledge that she was 
Bothweil^s wife, intimate the preten4ed marriage to which 
she was compelled. And the other extraordinary and more 
unlawful means, refer neither to ^^matorious potions nor to 
stupyifying draughts, but, according to the opinions of the 
^ge, to witchcraft 5 means more unlawful ;^nd extraordi- 
iiary than force or fear, to ^hich her extreme passion for 
Bothwell was ascribed by her enemies, as well as by her

But perceyvynge the sayde Lordes absent dyde not myndc

noblenjen and wyse men absent, and such as I coulde have

The Earle Bodwell hathe been of late with the Earic of

he hathe attempted to leyve force and to make somi styrre. 
But thoughe the Earle of Huntleye weereholden suspected

shoulde myscarye, to'ryd the Quene and hys sister of so

dyd hastielye retyre himself awaye from the Earl of HuEt-

Queues detencyon or a worse fate, and concurre with the 
LL. in all thynges, so as the crowning of the prynce nor 
none other act may defeat them of thyre possybylj^ie to

THE original act of council is lost or a missing, and an 
inacaurate English copy, found in the Cecil papers, is per- 
haps the only one extanti It is obvious that the mistake 
of andy for or, might have been committed either by the 
transcriber of the original record, by Haynes, or by the prin- 
ter, in transcribing or publishing the Cecil copy. From 
collating that copy with the act of parliament, in which the 
act of council is resumed, or engrossed verbatim^ Robertson 
proved its inaccuracy in other words; hltid^j^ for blindly 
affectionat, her proceeding in apriveit^ for her proceeding 
to an fretendii marriage with Bothwell, and all men abhor- 
ring their traine and companie for their tyrannie and com- 
panie. Whitaker considers these as merely Macgill's the 
Clerk Register's improvements in parliament, upon the 
language of Hay the clerk of council. But the clerk of 
council was invariably one of the deputy clerks of the I^ord 
Register, under whose inspection its records were frame4 » 
(First Report of the Committee of the House of Commons 
on the' Public Records, p. 39.) and an act intended to be 
converted into a law, when attested by Macgiil himself, 
and the whole council, was undoubtedly framed by the 
same hand with the act of parliament in which it was en- 
grossed. Such mistakes as bludy for blindlie^ priveit for 
pretendity traine for tyrannie, may be easily traced to those 
contractions so frequent in old MSS. which rendered the 
Scotch words unintelligible to an English transcriber. The 
confederates in their order for the queen's imprisonment 
in Lochlevin, (Appendix, No. XL) in their first bond, 
(Keith, 405.) and in their answer to Throckmorton, uni- 
formly term Bothwell a tyrant, and the marriage a pre- 
tended, not a private marriage ; and the context, that she

horred, not their traine, but their tyrannie and companie. The

compared with the act of parliament in Anderson or Good-

But Argyle, Huntley^ and Hemes, were engaged in the

without their submission, would neither hate been admitted 
to their seats, nor would the two former have been chosen 
as lords of articles, or selected to bear the regalia, at the first 
parliament held in the king's name. Their submission there- 
fore is certain, and they protested for their own security, 
that no fault should be imputed to them for any cause 
begun or done since the i<:^h of July, for which the reg^t 
accordingly freely forgave them. The only material error 
which I have discovered in Robertson, is, the reliance in- 
advertently placed in his Dissertation, upon the other unau« 
thenticated paper, or the Account of Lord Henries' beha- 
viour, who made a notable harangue in the name of the 
duke and his friends (the Duke, Cassillis and Kilwinning 
being present) for their uUon and submission to the re- 
gent, that if the queen were in Scotland with 20,000 men, 
they would be of the same mind ; and hoping that Huntley, 
Argyle, and others, (not present) would do the same. Ro- 
bertson, ii. 339 — ^461. Hamilton, Cassillis, and Kilwiiming 
were absent, Argyle and Huntley were present at the par-* 
fiament 1567, and the Account is evidently a Paper of in- 
telligence from the north of England, to which, as to 
other papers we have met with, a conjectural and false

In abridging the numerous papers, which I have occa- 
sion to recite, I frequently adhere to the original words : 
for the fidelity of the abstract, I must appeal to the apo- 
logists for Mary themselves. Tytler, however, has affirmed 
on the authority of this commission, that Mary, before she 
ij^reed to the conference, had insisted (on) and got Eliza- 
beth's promise, that neither Murray nor his associates, should 
be admitted to her presence, any more than Mary herself. 
Tytler, i. 1 08-21. The words of the commission are, 
" Knawing that the nobilitie of this realme are to assemble, 
and the matter maybe proponit in publick, we are resolute, 
considering the matter that was spoken and promisit, that 
during this conference, the Erie of Murray principal of 
our rebels, suld not come in the presence of the Queue our 
gude sister, mair nor we : but be the contrair he being res- 
savit and welcomit unto hir, and wc ane free princess not 
having access to answer for our selves, as he and his com- 
plices ; thinks therefoir ye can proceid na farther in this 
conference 5 for ther may be some heids proponit quhairto 
you can not answer of your selfis, unless we were there in 
proper persoun, to give answer to the calumnies quhilk may 
come in question aganis us, swa that partiality appeirs to be 
tisit manifestly." Goodall,ii. 184. " Considering what wa? 
spoken and promised," refers to the assurance of Elizabeth's 
favour, in consequence of which, she was resolute, thatMur-^ 
ray should have no more access than herself ; and she con- 
cludes, that her commissioners should dissolve the confe- 
rence, not for breach of promise, which they never ventured 
to insinuate, as no promise was ever mad^, but for manifest

partiality as they could not answer to the calumnies (of 
which she was fully aware) unless she were there in person. 
In her intercepted letters to her partizans in S^otlandj the 
informs them indeed, that the conference was broken upon 
account of Elizabeth's breach of promise, " not to permit 
the Earl of Murray to come to her presence afoir the con- 
ference was endit, and mairover ther $uld be nothing don 
to the prejudice of Mary's honour, estate, or right." 
Haynes, 504. But the whole letter is filled with the most 
extravagant fictions, and as the last promise, for the preser- 
vation of her honour, is certainly fal^e, so the first is refuted 
by the uniform silence of her commissioners at the con- 
ference. It appears ifrom Haynes (490) that the commis- 
sioners for the Queen of Scots, and the regent and his 
assistants, being called to the queen's majesty, her highness 
thought good to join more in commission to the former 
commissioners. Murray was admitted therefore as a com- 
^lissioner, as the queen's were also admitted, to consent to 
the commission being enlarged, and transferred to West- 
minster. Anderson, iii. 25. The complaint of partiality 
therefore, because he obtained an audience before the con- 
ferences were renewed, was a mere pretext, not employed 
to prevent the renewal of the conferences, but reserved to 
prevent the accusation, or the evidence, against the queen»

. IT was from the Minutes of this da/s proceedings In 
Mary's register, that Tytler ventured to give Hume the lie, 
(page 45. first edit.) for which he was afterwards so severely 
chastised. Tytler in his subsequent editions, has softened, 
and almost suppressed the charge ; but it is observable that, 
wIl^ he accused Hume of falsehood, he durst not give a 
feir quotation of the minute itself. After Mary's commis* 
siona:^ had shewn their instructions, for answering the ac- 
cusation, and ** desyrit the Quenis Majestie to cause thame 
have sic writingis as wei producit aganis thair maistrcs, be

^* And adhering to the protestations nmid be thame of befoir^ 
find upon the conditiounis containit in thair writingis, thair * 
maistres wald mak answer thairto." Goodall, ii. 282. - 
Their former protestations were those of the 25th of No- 
vember and 3d of December, to answer to nothing touch- 
ing her honour : the conditions contained^ in their instructions 
or writings, which Tytler has also omitted, were, " that 
the presence of our gude Sister, be permitted us to declair 
the justice of our cause to herself and no uther, not having 
consented to the assembly and convention of commissioners 
to uther effect, than to inform them of the veritiej"(id. 284.) 
and Tytler, in his abstract of the Conferences (i. 1 36-70,) 
conceals throughout, that Mary refused to answer, unless 
admitted in person before Elizabeth, contrary, as Hume 
observes, to her practice during the whole course of 
the conference, till the moment the evidence of her 
being an accomplice in her husband's murder was unex**

maintains throughout, were unconditionally refused. The 
truth obliges me to declare that Tytler did not understand 
the controversy, but wrote like a lawyer pleading from his 
brief; selecting what was advantageous for his client, not 
soHcitous to discover, or to ascertain the truli, ^* Verum

sa. I will bide his fead and all his kins then, quoth he. 
Pray to God for me, and let him direct all. Sa, be the 
printing of his chronicle was ended, that maist learned, 
wise and godly man ended this mortal life." 

Buchanan's dedication of his history to James is dated 
August 28th 5 this visit was early in September, and as 
Buchanan died on the 28th of that month, the history, if 
printed, was certainly not published before his death. Ac- 
cording to Melvil's MS., the printing was just finished 
with his life, and his final repentance must have hap- 
pened in the interval, betwe'en the visit and his death. 
His Detection was an anon3rmous pamphlet, easily disa- 
vowed, had he been so inclined. But that he had fire-' 
gently lamented to James, those calumnies in the Detec- 
tion ^ich he has transcribed verbatim in his history ; that 
he wished, when it was too late, to retract those calumnies 
in his history, which at that moihent were under the 
press, but which he was afraid to retract kst it should be 
ascribed to dotage; are obvious, and incoherent fictions 
to conceal hb impenitence, or his refusal perhaps to sup- 
press any part* of his writings when required by James. 
Thuanus's information, that he was required by James, 
but refused, to retract what he had written of Mary, is con- 
firmed by his traditionary answer ; ** Tell him I am going 
to a place where few kings can come." Mackenzie's Lives 
of Scottish Writers, iii. 180. Bayle's Diet. The king, in 
consequence of the Raid of Ruthven, (August 2jd) was 
detained at Perth 5 but Lennox remained at Edinburgh 
till September 5th ; (Calderwood, iii. 15 15) and his earnest 
application to Gourie, two months afterwards, for the ori- 
ginal l<;tters from Mary to Bbthweli, (Robertson, ii. 381.) 
renders it not improbable that he made a similar applica- 
tion from the king to Buchanan brfore his death. Ruddi-

man In his Animadversions on his opponent, John Love, 
quibbles miserably upon the authority of Melvil's Diary or 
Life, till his bigotry fairly consigns Buchanan to hell, which 
the humanity of his biographer has softened and suppressed. 
Ruddiman's Animadversions, i j. Ch^lmer'!? Life of Ru^-- 
diman, 230. 

The story of Buchanan's repentance was revived ki 1714, 
by the author of the Life of Sage, who received it in a letter 
from Sage himself, who had it from lady Rosyth, an old 
lady, who had it from David Buchanan, an old man, who 
was present, and an car witness to Buchanan's confession. 
As Sir George Buchanan of Buchanan died in 1651, 
lady Rosyth, his daughter, might have conversed with 
David Buchanan, the editor of Knox's history, before his 
death. David Buchanan, however, was the second son of 
William, fourth laird of Arnprior : John the first laird 
was killed in 1547, at the battle of Pinkey ; Andrew the 
second laird was alive in 1560 ; but that his great grand- 
son was old enough to witness Buchanan's confession in 
1582, is altogether incredible. Again, David Buchanan 
published Knox's History in 1643, sixty-one years after 
Buchanan's death. His elder brother John was killed in 
the Irish massacre, 1641 j his younger brother William 
fought as a captain at the battle of Inverkeithing, 1651, 
and he was alive himself, cultivating letters in 1649 j 
facts utterly incompatible with his presence as a witness at 
Buchanan's confession. Buchanan's Family and Surname 
of Buchanan, 35 — 61. Nicholson's Scot. Hist. Library, 75. 
That confession should have convinced him of Mary's in-* 
nocence; but the continuation of Knox's History, which, 
as it is found in no preceeding MS., must be ascribed to 
David Buchanan the editor, is written under a strong im- 
pression of her guilt. Sage was probably ignorajit of

tribui I (MS. Adv. Lib.) containing an account of Buchanan, 
in which the author would not have omitted^ had he wit- 
nessed, the circumstances of his confession and death. 
Spottiswood, who was seventeen at Buchanan's death, was 
equally ignorant of his repentance and confession, which 
James himself, to whom it was frequently uttered^ and from 
whom Camden's information must have proceeded, durst 
not insert among his invectives against Buchanan in hii 
Basilicon Doron. Such confessions are the usual resort 
of party: at the instigation it is said of James, who fur^ 
nished the materials, a recantation was once forged for 
Calderwood, on a report of his death, which he survhed, 
however, to refute ; and Sage, though silent in his contro* 
versial works concerning those confessions, has been made 
to vouch for another, of Henderson the covenanter, whicb, 
from Baillie's letters and the declaraticms of the gener^ 
assembly, is demonstratively false. 

Having mentioned Spottiswood, whom I seldom quote, 
let me bestow just approbation on his memory as an histo^ 
rian. Of the same age nearly with James, he conversed 
and lived with Mary's contemporaries, and had every op- 
portunity to refute Buchanan if his facts were false, and 
every inducement to misrepresent them if true- When 
desired by James to undertake his history, Camden's An- 
nals must have taught him what was expected 5 yj^ 
though he blames Buchanan for the bitterness of his 
writings, he adopts his facts, of which nothing less than 
contemporary evidence could have convinced him in op* 
position to his inclination and interest. Buchanan's nar* 
rative receives the strongest confirmation, when exposed 
to the same test both by Thuanus and by SpottiswoocJ*

^ There was no recepte could serve againste feare.] Quoted also as 
proverbially Scotch, as if Mary's reply to Lennox, in a Scottish 
proverb, when repeiated in a letter, could render that letter ori- 
\ ginaily Scotch. The Scottish proverb is, " There is nare- 

medie for fear but cut off the head;" (Kelly's Scotch Prov.) 
the French, " On pent bien guerir du mal, mais on ne sauroit 
guerir de la peur ;" (Diet, de PAcad.) and these proverbial 
expressions in the letters, supposed to possess such curious fe- 
licity and spirit in Scotch, are either common to modem lan- 
guages, or peculiar to the French, from which the whole pas- 
sage, as well as the phrase in question, is evidently derived.

that he came not to meet me, because he Aarst liot entcr-t 
Jirizc so to do, considering the sharp worcjs that I had* 
spoken toConyngham, and that he desired that I would' 
come to the enquisition of the facts which I did suspect 
him of*. This last was of his own head without commis- 
sion ; and I told him that he had no reccipt^against fear, 
aad that he had no fear, if he did not feel himself fauky. 
And that I had also sharply answered to the doubts that he 
made in his letters as though there had been a 

meaning to pursue him. To be short, I have made him 
hold his peace ; for the rest it were too long to tell you. 
Sir James Hamilton came to meet me, who told me that at 
another time he went his way when he heard of my coin- 
fear,** (n^avoit point de peur) " if he did wot feel himself (se troU' 
vol^^ faulty," " the doubts tliat he made^^ (qu*iljit) sharply an- 
swered,*' point out the precise idiom of the French original. • 

^ The rest were lang to write,'] Le reste seroit trop long a vous 
dirtf as in the English version ; and the Latin summay which 
recurs so frequently, and was then prefixed to the sum total 
of accounts, is indisputably a substitute for the Frenph word 
iommey in short. " Somme, elle nous renvoya au roy, sur ses 
termes de lui dire le tout." Murdin, 237. 

* The uther time.'] Qu* autrefoisy formerly, of which the literal 
translation, " the uther time," perplexes Whitakerto discover 
upon what former occasion it happened, ii. 27. Buchanan 
informs us incidentally, that when she had returned to Stir- 
ling, in the beginning of January, " quotidie se Glasguam 
ituram ostendent,"(349) upon which occasion Lennox, suspi- 
cious that his son was poisoned, and that he himself was in 
danger, left Glasgow, not on her arrival, but upon the report 
of her coming, of which she received the first intimation on 
her arrival now. And from this circumstance the forgery is 
inferred, because there was no preceding journey which would 
Jiave rendered the present intelligence unnecessary.

town came to speak with me, which maketh me to think 
that they be his, and they so speaketh well of them, at 
least his son. The king sent for loachim and asked hinf * 
why I did not lodge nigh to him, and that he would rise 
, sooner, and when I came, whether it were for any good 
appointment that he came, and whether I had not taken 
Paris and Gilbert to write, and that I sent Joseph. I wonder 
who hath told him so much even of the marriage of Bas- 
tian. This bearer shall tell you now, upon that I asked him 
of his letters. And where he did complain of the cruelty 
.of some of them. He said that he did dreme, and that he 
was so glad to see me that he thought he should die, in- 
deed that he had found fault with me. 



Tily converts it into officers of state ; or into ** one of those ab- 
surdities which crowd the letters, or marks of forgery inserted 
by chance," ii. 42. 407. The precise meaning is ascertained 
however by the king's enquiries concerning the alterations in 
her household ; the admission of Paris (not as Goodall sup- 
poses to write, but) as her chamberlain, and Gilbert (Curl) 
as her secretary, the departure of Joseph ( Rizio's brother) 
?ind the marriage of Bastian with her confidential maid. 

'^ Sum<what upon this.'] The marginal note in the English edi- 
tion^ >sras probably an omission, not of the original, but of the 
Scottish version, in which it was inserted on the margin, a$ 
^he English translation preserves it in its proper place in the 
text. Whitaker's conclusion that the note waB superinduced 
after the letters were shewn at York, (ii. ^T.) is founded on a 
mistalce already corrected, (supra, ch. iv. n. 22.) of the Scotch 
Extracts for the English Abstract, both of which we have ai^ 
nexed to these letters,

derived from a French original. " So couldly and so wyislie/'

figurative sense, signifies " d'un maniere s^rieuse et reserve ;'*

wisely, but in a manner so serious and prudent, as would 
astonish Bothwell. 

*9 Refush to suhscnye the same.'] The passage refers to Minto*? 
preceding information, that a letter to imprison Damley, or to 
slay him, K he made resistance, had been brought to the 
queen. But the English translator, not perceiving the refer- 
ence, mistook signer for saigner^ and from a passage in the next 
letter, converted the queen's i:ipfusal to sign the warrant, into 
a refusal to have him let blood. The difference not only demon* 
strates that the English is not derived from tl^e Scotch, but^ 
that the two Vjerstons are both derived from a French original.

hand-writing must have degeperated into a mere scrawl. In 
all her letters, if the three first lines are regularly formed like 
Italick print, (as in the Plate, No. 1.) the rest successively de- 
viate into a straggling distorted scrawl, (ibid, No. 2.) and are 
almost utterly illegible when written in haste ; which explains 
the obscurity and frequent difference of the two versions, as 
the original was so hastily and badly written, that it was ne- 
cessary to guess the one half.

The questions that he asked of loachim^ of my state^

The talk that he and I have had, and of his desire to 
please me, of his repentance, and of the interpretation of

I had forgotten of the L. of Livingstoun, that he a) 
supper said softly to the lady Reres, that he drank to the 
persons I knew of, if I would pledge them. And after ^pper 
he said softly to me, when I was leaning upon him and 
warming myself, you may well go and see sick folk, yet can 
you not be so welcome unto them, as you have this day 
left some body in pain, who shall ne'er be merry till ht 
hath seen you again. I asked him who it was ; he took me 
about the body, and said one of his folk that hath kft yott 
this day. Guess you the rest.

which Tytler turns into a Scotch proverb, (i. 228.) as if Li- 
vingston's address to the queen in a Scotch phrase, could provt 
that the letter was in the same language. But the English 
version ascertains the original French phrase of which those 
writers were ignorant ; c'est un beau vene%y voir des gens ma-

between us two) the lords wished no ill to him, but did 
fear lest, considering the threatening which he made in 
case we did agree together, he would make them feel the 
small account they have made of him, and that he would

Caligula, D. i, ; but the passage in question was obliterated 
by the fire in the Cotton Library, October 23, 1731, abov« 
twenty years before Goodall published. From the context, 
and from the English version, " it is obvious that some more 
secret invention by medicine, for he should take medicine and

tinS send me word what I shall do, and whatsoever happen 
to me, I will obej you. Thmk also if yon will not find 
Sonic invention more sectet by physick, for he is to take 
physick at Craigmillar, and the bath ailso, and shall not 
come forth of long time. To be short, for th^xt I can 
learn, he hath great suspicion, and yet, nevertheless, trust- 
eth upon my word, but not tell me as yet any thing; how- 
beit, if you will that I shall avow him> I will know all of 
him, but I shall never be willing to beguile one who put- 
teth his trust in me'. Nevertheless, you may do all, and da 



France by land. To obviate the imputation of poisori, (ioocf* 
all quotes and describes the MS. as the identical copy present^, 
ed to Elizabeth, yet he durst not specify where it was lodged. 

The Detectio; Maris Caligula, D. I., uniformly describes 
Murray, qu nunc est prorex^ which was altered in the Latin edi- 
tion to prorex poskafuit^ and in one place X.o postea prorex^ nunc 
et ipse occisus est. The interlineations are in a different hand 
from the text 5 and the running margin is different from both; 
nor are the corrections always observed in the printed edition. 
The Action and Letters are annexed in the same hand, which 
might at first seem to indicate, that the whole was Bucha- 
nan's. But the Afction contains no note of time, to ascertain 
whether it was writtefi before, or after Murray's death ; whom 
the MS; of the Detection never mentions, without the ad- 
dition, qui nunc est prorexy as then aKve. As every such allu- 
sion is avoided in tlie Action, I conclude that the MS. ii;i 
question was a fair copy, corrected and submitted to Cecil 
by Wilson, before his autograph was sent tp the press. Asa 
^farther confirmation, the title of the Action is superinduced 
upon the margin, and the title of the Letters is left blank, to 
be supplied, together with the running margin of the Action 
and Letters, when sent to the press.

LETTER 11. 

A Letter written by hirfrom Glasgow to Bothwelt^ 
proving bir knte to hir husband^ and some suspicions 
of practising hys deaths quhilk letter was written in 
Frenchy and l^ere ensuetb translatit word for word. 

Jl semhle qi! avecques vostre absence sott joynt touhly^ veu

IT appearis that with your absence there is alswa jomit 
forgctfulncs, seand that at your departing you promisit to 
make me advertisement of yow newis from tyme to tyme* 
The awaytyng upon tham yesterday ' causit me to be alt 
maist in sic joy as I will be at your returning, quhilk yc 
have dclayit langer then your promise was *. As to me, 
howbeit, I havei na further newis from you, according to

* The awaytyiig upon tham yesterday,'] En les attendant hier, 
(expecting to hear from him) an appropriate Trench phrase, of 
which, the oiumiting npon news, is a literal and harsh translation, 

* Causitlme to be in almaist siejoy as I will be at yopr returning, 
qiihilk {nevrs) ye have delayit langer then your promise was.'] En 
les attendant hier me causerent presqu' autant d^ joie que 
j'en auraia votre retour, que vous avez di^iries plus long tems 
que votre promesse. Here the peculiar construction of the 
French participle, vous me promistes de vos nouvelles'-'en les 
attendant— ^jAf vous avez differ ees, at once removes the ambi* 
guity of the translations. Bothwell had promised, not to 
return, but to let her hear from him yesterday, which he had 
deferred longer than his promise was ; and, to authenticate 
the letters, the obvious meaning of the passage, can be ei» 
pressed literally in no other than in the original languagCf 
SeeVol. I. p. 290.

therto confined to bed, had desired her last night, ** to come 
and see him rise the mombetyme/* (le voir se lever demain;) 
and she describes his health and gaiety that morning tovBoth« 
well. All this is inconsistent, says Whitaker, with his being 
still so weak as to be conveyed in a litter to Edinburgh j a« 
if gaiety were incompatible with his convalescence, and unex- 
pected reconciliation with the queen, his wife. 

^ Makis love to me.] In the extracts of the Scotch commis- 
sioners, ** h^ makes the court to me ;" a literal translation of 
the French phrase, yb/r^ la courts alterisd to, " makes love to

at more length." Murdin, 158. The coincidence between this, 
aXid her letter to Bothwell, is somethingHior^ than fortui- 
tous ; as that which was natural and unavoidable to Mar^ 
when the pain was actually present, was thie last circumstance 
likely to occur to the forgers, at the distance of many months, 
vrhen her complaints were forgotten. But the fortuitous 
coincidence of the supposed forgery, both in the disease and in 
the medicine, with a genuine letter of a subsequent date, 
would be surprising indeed.

ture and derivation is evidently French ; and the conceit, as 
far as it is intelligible, seems to be, that his name and memory 
were inclosed in her heart, like her hair in the ring, never to 
come forth till her death gave him such another (a ring fullit, 
or filled with her bones and hair) as a trophy of his conquest 
and of her afiPection. Such quaint and absurd conceits are 
plainly employed to adapt a mourning ring, containing her 
own and her first husband's, or perhaps, her mother's hair, 
to the occasion of the marriage.

De vous je dis, seu! soutien de ma vie. ' 

And as the sonnets were confessedly written in French, no 
doubt can remain of the language to which those expressions 
belong. But the structure of the whole sentence is so strictly 
French^ and so peculiar to Mary, that we discover the same 
phraze and inversion (and to me your gude favour) in a letter 
to Elizabeth, " pour /frier Dieu qtt'il vous doinct en sainte ires 
Jnureuse et longue vie, et a moi patience, et la consolation que 
j*entend recevoir de vous." May 17> 1568. Calig. C. 1. The 
same conclusions also, are so frequent in her correspondence^ 
that of fourteen letters to Elizabeth, from her arrival in 
£ngland till Sept. XB^S^ eleven conclude " tn priant Dieu qu'il 
vous doint en sante longue et heureuse vie/* and three with some

Translated " to serve him truly.** But the structure and 
inversion of the sentence (unto you humble and obedleni lawful 
*wlfe) are peculiarly French ; and the transition from the first, 
to the third person was familiar to Mary, who writes to Eli- 
, zabeth, " Ma bonne soeur gaynes moy \ envoyes moy querir ; 
n'entres en jalousie pour faulx rapportes de celle qui ne desire 
que votre bonne grace." Aug. 27, 1568. Calig. C. 1.

Here the Scotch phrase varies with the old French, from 
change to es change ; and the different arrangement of the two 
phrases, " It behoves us to do ^W and to shun m/," Ufaut 
eviter le mal et faire le bien, marks the original to which the 
French idiom, evil nor gude belongs. But, whoever compares 
the letters with a single State-paper, or other letter of the 
period, Scotch or English, inserted in our appendix, will be 
satisfied that the former possess the genuine refined idioms of 
a French original ; and through the medium of a homely 
translation, will easily discover an elegance to which our 
language was then a stranger.

shawing of the truth, &C.5 after lang conference, and

said John Brand minister said unto him. Sir, althocht I am

hope this night to sowp, I shall declaire unto you the haill, 
from the beginning imto the end of my pairt. First, I 
confess that the earle Bothwell shetv that samen wickit 
deid unto me, in his his own chalmer in the abbey, qn Fry- 
day before the deid wes done, and requyred me to take pairt 
with him therein^ because, as he alledged, I wes ane man of 
activeness, (alace theirfor!) quhair I utterly refuisit, and 
said, God forbid, hot, gif it were upon the field, to fight

gallant captain Crawford of Jordanhill, so distinguished 
afterwards by taking Dumbarton castle; and the accusa- 
tion was probably instigated by Cecil, to crush Lcthing- 
ton's busy intrigues for Mary's divorce, restoration, and 
marriage with Norfolk. Tlxat the delay of the trial was 
not collusive, appears from the following facts which 
honest Goodall, who quotes Murray's ^cch, has suppressed 
in order to vindicate Bothwell, by representing the whole 
as a mere artifice for the preservation of Lethington, the 
regent's associate in the murder. Goodall, i. 397 • 

** Upon the 21st of November, the day appointed for 
Lethington to underly trial, and the verdict of ane assize, 
many noblemen and gentlemen repaired to Edinburgh 
whom he had written for to maintain him as he pretended 
in his innocency and just cause. His friends were all that 
were unfriends to the king or privy to the murther, all the 
Hamiltons, Huntley, Argyle, Athol, Seton, Boyd, Livingston, 
Fleming, and the Hepbums. Hume came with the Hep- 
burns and other friends to Edinburgh, and Athol, Huntley, 
and the Hamiltons came to Linlithgow | who being 
charged be the regent to come no nearer, stayed. The earl 
of Morton, with three thousand, lay at Dalkeith, waiting 
till the regent sent for him. Lethington, confident in the 
power of the other faction, which was strong, notwith- 
standing that Norfolk was committed to prison, urged 
trial, and bragged of his- innocency. The regent finding 
the convocation of his friends and followers so great by 
expectation, sent for the chief noblemen in the town, to 
whom he made an oration, as after followeth to this sense : 
For as meikle as, when ye interprised the revenge of the 
king's slaughter, I was in France, where ye sent to me, and 
desired me to come home, and take upon me the regiment, 
ye cau$ed me take an oath that I should to the uttermost

BUCHANAN, Melvil, and Spottiswood assure us, that 
Both well died mad, and the two last, writing after James 
had wintered in Denmark, must have known the fac^. 
Turner, in order to authenticate the confession, first as- 
serted, in 1588, that Bothwell's madness was a fiction o£ 
Buchanan's; and the credulousWhitaker believes, on Good* 
alTs authority, that he lived at large, unconfined, in Den- 
mark. But Crawford's MS. informs us, that he was com- 
mitted to close prison till his death 5 the Summarium de 
Morte Mariae, published I587,that, " inDania captus, amens 
obiit*' (Jebb, ii. 166), and Thuanus assures us, seemingly 
fi-om particular information, that as soon as discovered, he 
was imprisoned atDracholm," in aratissimis vinculis, in qui- 
bus cum accusatus esset ab amicis cujusdam nobilis virginis 
Norvegicae, quam ante plures annos, pacto matrimonio vio- 
latam, alia super tnductaj deseruerat, post decennium accc- 
dcnte amentia dignum flagitiosa vita exitum habuit," ii. 55 1. 
The Norwegian lady whom he had debauched when be- 
trothed to her some years before, and deserted for another, 
explains a passage in Buchanan, that before his marriage 
with the queen, duas uxores adhuc vivas habuit, tertiamipse 
nuper suum fassus adulteirium dimisisset ; (Lib. xviii. 357) 
and suggested the crimes in his confession, that he had de- 
bauched a Danish lord's two daughters, and two daughters 
of a lord at Lubeck, &c. His body was greatly swelled in 
summer, 1575 (Murden, 285) j and he seems to have died 
about the end of that year. His age his been strangely 
controverted. Buchanan had represented James, iQstead

of Patrick, £arl of Bothwell, as Lennox's rival for tlic queen 
regent's hand ; and Tytler, who was slightly versed in the 
controversy, and in the history of the period, grasped at the 
mistake, and concluded -that Bothwell, who treurted tl^ 
mother in 1544, must have been an old man, upwards of 
^ty, when he. married the daughter in 1567. Tytler, 
3 edit* 281. The mistake had been previously corrected by 
Thomas Crawford (Notes on Buchanan, 141) and by Rud- 
dipian (Buchananari Opera, i* 452) ; but when Lord Hailes 
(discovered thatPatrick, BothwcU's father, died in September 
1556, and that Mary herself described Bothwell eight years 
aftorward^, as ^^ in his verie youth at his first eritcris into 
this realm, immediately after the deceise of his fadder," 
(Remarks^ j 73. Anderson, i. 89), Lord Elibank and Tytler 
devised another conclusion, that Buchanan, by anticipation, 
described Bothwell by his future titles, when coBrting the 
queen regent in 1544, and that, he was forty-fbiu- at least 
when he married the queen. Lord Elibank's letter to Lord 
Hailes, 30. Tytler, ii. 155. To argue against suth writcn 
would be ridiculous, as it is sufficient to state their mi^ 
quotation of Buchanan. " Accessit aemulus Jacobus Hep» 
bumus comes Bothwellise, Ac. L enim ab Jaeobo qmnto re* 
legatusy ac etafim eo mortuo domum reversusy eisdem ardbui 
regiuse vidu« nuptias ambiebat," &c. Lib. xvi. p. 285. The 
Earl of Bothwell, whom James had banished in 1537, was 
. Patrick, the earl formerly imprisoned in 1 53 1 , and divorced 
firom . his wife> most probably on his return from exile, 
,when he paid his addresses to the queen regent. Goodall, 
ii..3i9. BothwelFs- mother was alive at the murder of 
Damley (Paris's iFix'st Confession); and if born when his 
father was banished, Bothwell himself might be nineteen 
at his father's death, and less than thirty on his marris^ 
with thf queen. From her word$ cp^ot^d abovci he ^

wife for another, as he passed through England to France,

Morton^ John Durie^ and Mr, Walter Balcanquelli and 

the cheif things that they hard of him quhcurof they can r/- 

memher^ that day that the said Eirle suffered^ quhilk was the 

' second of yuniij 1581. 

FIRST, the said eirle being exhorted that he sould not 
be discouraged in consideration of that estate quhairinto 
ance he was in this world in honour and glbrie, and of the 
downcast quhairunto now he was brought, but rather in 
consideration of the glorie to come, he sould rejoice and be 
of gude comfort, his answer was, as concerning all the 
glorie that I have had in this world, I cair not for it, be- 
cause I am persuaded now that all the honours, riches, 
friends, pleasures, and quhatsomever I had in the world, is 
but vanitie, and as concerning the estate quhairunto now I 
am brought, I thank God for it, and am at this poynt, that 
I am content rather to render my lyfe then to live, because 
I know that as God has appoynted the tyme of my death, 
so has he appoynted the manner thereof j and therefore, 
seeing that now is the time, and this is the manner that 
best pleiseth my God to take me, I am content, and as for 
my lyfe in this world, I cair not for it a penny, in respect 
of that immortalitie and everlasting joy quhilk I luke for, 
and quhairof I am assured. 

2. Being requyred quhat was his part or knowledge in 
the king's murther, he answered with this attestation, as I 
sail answer to my Lord God, I sail declare trewlie all 
my knowledge in that matter, the soume quhairof is this :

Meininr for Davic's slaughter, I came out of Wcdcrbum to Wh!t- 
^|f"^^^J.^tiDghame, quhair the cirie Bothwell and I met togciher in 
8iaiie,i565,^jjgya;|.(i of Whittinghame, quhair, efter long commtming 
nion of the the cirlc Bothwell proponed to me the ku^g^s mtuther, rc- 
^"*"* quyring what wald be my part therein, seeing it was the 
queines mynd that the king sould be taine away, because, 
as he said, she blamed the king mair of Davie's slaughter 
than me. My answer to the eiric Bothwell was this, that I 
wald not in any ways mell with that matter, and that for 
this cause, because I am but new cumed out of trooble, 
quhairof as yet I am not red, being discharged to cum 
neir the court be seven mylls, and therefore, I cannot enter 
myself in such a trouble againe. Efter this answjer, Mr. 
Archbald Douglas entered in conference with me b that 
purpose, persuading me to agrie to the eirie Bothwcll's de- 
syre. Last of all the eirle Bothwell, being in Whitting- 
hame, thairafter eimestly proponed the same matter again 
to me, persuading me thairto, because so was the queines 
mynd, and shoe wald have it to be done. Unto this my 
answer was, I desyred the eirle Bothwell to bring me the 
queines hand wryt of this matter for a warrand, and then 
I sould give him ane answer : utherwayes I wald not mdl 
therewith, quhilk warrand he never purchaissed (reported, 
Calderwood's MS.) unto me. Thenrbeing inquyred quhat 
wald have beine his part in caise he had gotten the queines 
warrand in that matter, wald he in respect thairof, mdled 
with such a filthie murther as that ? He answered, gif I 
had gotten the queines wryt, and so had knowen her 
mynd, I was purposed to have banished i^ysclfe againe, 
and turned my back on Scotland quhile I had sein a better 
occasion. Then following forth his discourse of this mat-r 
ter, he said, I being at St. Andro's to vissit the eirle of 
Angus a little before the murther, Mr.. Archbald Douglas

Both well, -to shew unto me that the purpose of the king's ^ 

murther was to be done, and neir a pojmt, and to request 
my concurrence and asy stance thereunto. My answer was 
to him, that I wald give no answer to that purpose, seeing T 
had not gotten the queines warrand in wryt, quhilk was 
promised, and thairfore seeing the cirle Bothwell never re- 
ported any warrand- of the queine to me, I never melled , ' 
farther with it. Then being inquyred whether he gave 
Mr. Archbald Douglas, any command to be there in his 
name, he answered, I never commanded himJ Being in- ' 
quyred gif he gave him any counsel thereunto, he answer- 
ed, I never counselled him to it : being inquyred if he gave 
him any counsel in the contrair, he answered I never 
counselled him in the contrair. Then it was said to him, 
that it was a dangerous thing for him that his servand and , 
depender was to pass to such a wicked purpose, and he 
knowing thereof stayed him not, sieing it would be counted 
his deid : he answered, Mr. Archbald at that tyme was a 
depender upon the eirlc Bothwell, niaking court for him- 
self, rather then a depender of myne. Efter this following 
forth the same discourse, he said Mr. Archbald, cfier the 
deid was done, shew to me that he was at the deid doeing, 
and came to the Kirk of Field yard with the eirle Bothwell 
and Huntlie. Then being requyred if he received Mr. 
Archbald efter the murther, he answered I did indeed. 
Then it was said to him, appeirantlie my lord, ye cannot 
complain jusdie of the sentence that is given against you, 
sieing with your oun mouth ye confess the foreknowledge 
and concealling of the king's murther, for quhilk two 
poynts onlie ye could not be able to abyd the law. He 
answered that I know to be trew indeid, but yet they sould 
havef considered the ^danger that the reveilling of it wald 
have brought me to at that tyme ; for I durst not reveill it 
for feir of my lyfe. For at that tyme to whom sould I have

rcveillcd it ? To the qucine ? she was the doer thercot 
I was mynded to have told it to the king's selfe (father, Cal- 
deiwood) but I durst not for my lyfe, for I knew him to be 
t baime of such nature, that there was nothing told him 
but he wald revcill it to hir againe. Being inquyred why 
he wald not sinsyne reviell it to the king's majesty, he 
answered I durst not, for the same feir» Tlien he said, efter 
the eirle Bothwell was clcinged by an assyse, sundrie of the 
nobilitie, and I subscryed also a bond with the eirle Both- 
well, that if any sould lay the king's murder to his charge, 
we sould assyst him in the constrairie, and therefter I sub- 
scryed to the queines marriage with the eirle Bothwell, as 
sundrie uthers of the nobilitie did, being charged thereto 
by the queines wryt and command. Then being inquyred 
in name of the living God, that sieing this murther of the 
king's was ane of the most filthy acts that ever was done 
in Scotland, and the secreits thereof hes not yet been de- 
clared, who was the chief deid doers, or whether he was 
wirried or blown in the air, and therefore to declaire if he 
knew any farther secret thereunto ^ he answered, as I sail 
answer to (5dd, I know no more secret in that matter then 
I have already told and heard be the deposition of such as 
hes already suffered for it, quhilk depositions are yet ex- 
tant. Being inquyred if he knew any presentlie to be 
about the king, who was doers of that work, by whose com- 
panie the king or common weill might be hurt, he answer- 
ed, I know none, and will acuse none. Last of all, it was 
said to him concerning this purpose, that in respect of his 
own deposition, his part wald be suspected to be more foull 
nor he declared, he speired for what reason. It was an- 
swered, ye being in authoritie, howbeit ye punisht uthers 
for the murther, yet ye punisht not Mr. Archbald, whom 
ke knew to be guilty thereof; he answered, I punisht him 
not indeid, neither durst I^ for the causes before showen.

Thereafter he was" called to dinner at two after noune, 
and being at dinner, sieing the brethrein of the ministric 
were informed that there was wrong report made of his 
confessioune to the king, and that he sould have confessed 
meikle uther wayes then he did, whereby the king might . 
have had ane war opinion of him, they thought gudq to 
send down some before his suffering, to inform the king's 
majestie of the facts of his confessioune, as namely, David . 
Fergussone, John Durrie, and John Brand, who, before 
Jus death, at length told th^ simple truth of his conifes- 
sioune to the king's uiajestje. At their returning againc 
from tjie Abbey, his keiper requyred him that he sould 
cum forth to the scaffald, he answered, sieing they have 
troubled nje this day oyer meikle with warldly things, I 
supposed they sould have given pie this one nyght leasor 
to have advysed rypely with my God. His keiper said all 
things are readye now, my lord, and I think they will not 
stay : he answered, and I aip readie alsq, I prgyse my God ; 
an4 so, one con^fortable prayer being made, he passed down 
to the gate, mynding to goe directly to the scaffold ; but 
the eirle of Arrange stayed him^ and brought him back 
againe to his chalmer, and requyred of hini that he sould 
tarric till his confessioune were put in wryt, and subscryed 
with his hand and the ministers that were present. He 
answered, no, my ^ord, I pray you trouble me no more 
with these things, for I h^ve now another thing to advyse 
on, that is, to prepair me for my God, §ieing that I am now - 
at a poynt to go to death, I cannot wryt in the estate 
wherein now I am All the honest men can testifie what I

any particular against you. He answered, it is not tyme 
now to remember on querels, 1 have no querd to you nOT 
^y man 5 I forgive you and all uthers, as I will all to for^ 
give me ; and so therefter with a gude curagc he past to 
the scaffald, and being upon the scaffald, he rcpeits in few 
words the substance of these things^ the quhilk before 
lie had confessed, except that he concealed Mr. Archlxdd 
t)ouglas his name,and eiked some word and exhortatioun to 
the people, quhilk he spake not before, as namely, he said» 
Sure I am the king sail lose a gude secant thi$ day, and so 
he exhorted the people, saying, I testify before God, I have 
professed the evangell, quhilk this day is teached and pn>^ 
fessed in Scotland, and so also now I will willinglie lay 
down my lyfc in the professioun thereof; and howbeit, I 
have not walked therein as I aught, yet I am assured (3o4 
will be merciful to me ; and I pray you all, gude chris- 
tians, to pray for me ; and I charge you all, in the name 
of God, that are professors of the evangell, that yc co©n 
tinue in the true professioun- thereof, and maintain it to

lyfe, lands, and all, gif I had had dayes, quhilk if yc doc, 
I assure you God sail be merciful to you ; but if yc do not, 
be sure the vengeance of G04 saH light upon you beth ii^

quhilk he spake comfortably upon the scaffald, he spake 
^hem more amply before, and therefore wc think it no^ 
neidful to repeit. 

When all his speeches were ended upon tibc scaffold, si 
comfortable prayer was made by Mr. James Lawson, dur-.

a^ himself;" to which Morton made this remarkable reply: 
** That I know him innocent in my conscience as myself, 
the contrary thereof is true, for I was, and am innocent 
thereof, but could not affirm the same of him, considering 
what I understand in that matter, of his own confession to 
myself of before." Caiderwood, ii. 274-6. MS. That 
Lethington was as innocent as Morton, plainly implies that 
Morton was equally guilty with Lethington, who, instead 
of asserting his own innocence, merely insinuates that the 
ether was equally privy to the murder. But Morton, distin- 
guishing between the foreknowledge and the participation of 
•the crime, openly asserts his own innocence, and Lathing- 
ton's concern in the murder, which he understood from 
his own confession of before 5 and in these passages each 
alludes indisputably to the conference at Whittingham be- 
fore the murder. Secret overtures, however unsuccessful, 
arc seldom or never betrayed by politicians ; and Morton 
refused at his execution to accuse any of the king's atten- 
dants whom he was then unwilling to offend. X»ething- 
ton's brotloer, John Prior of Coldingham, afterwards chan- 
cellor, sat as one of the assessors to the justice depute upon 
Morton's trial, (Anderson's MSS.) and from the confession 
* of Binning, (who was tried and executed the very next day 
-after' Morton) it appears that he was privy, if not acc^^iry 
Xo th« murder. But Morton, from the same motive peiv 
haps, that induced him to suppress Archibald Douglas's 
name on the scaffold, concealed Lethington's share in the 
conference at Whittingham, out of tenderness both to the 
living and the dead.

A Letter from Mr. Archibald Douglas to the Queen 
of Scott s. Robertson's Hist. 

Please your majesty, I received your letter of the date April-— ^ 
the 1 2th of November, and in like manner has seen somc|^;g^'/' 
part of the contents of one other of the same date, directed f"- ^^^• 
to Monsieur de Movisir, ambassador for his majesty the. 
most christian king, both which are agreeable to your* 
princely dignity, as by the one your highness desires to 
know the true cause of my banishment, and offers unto me 
all favour if I shall be innocent of the heinous facts com- 
mitted in the person of your husband of good memory, ^o 
by the other the said ambassador is willet to declare unto 
me, if your husband's murder could be laid justly against 
me, that you could not soUicit in my cause, neither yet for 
any person that was participant of that execrable fact, but 
would seek the revenge thereof, when you should have any 
means to do it; your majesty's offer, if I be innocent of 
that crime, is most favourable, and your desire to know 
the truth of the same is most equitable ; and therefore 
that I should with all my simplicity,, sincerity and truth an* 
swer thereunto is most reasonable, to the end that your 
princely dignity may be my help, if my innocence shall 
sufficiently appear, and procure my condemnation, if I be 
culpable in any matter, except in the knowledge of the evil 
disposed minds of the most part of yoiw nobility against 
your said husband, and not revealing of it, which I am 
assured was sufficiently known to himself and to all that 
had judgment never so little in that realm ; which also I 
was constrained to understand, as he, that was specially 
employed betwixt the earl Morton, and a good number of 
jour nobility, that they might with all humility intercede

at your majesty's hand for his relief, in such matters as arc 
more specially contained in the declaration following, 
which I am constrained for my own justification, by this' 
kttcr to call to ycjur majesty's remembrance. Notwith- % 
^standing that I am assured to my grief, the reading thereof 
vriU not smally offend your princely mind. It may please 
your majesty to rcmlcmbcr, that in the year of God 1566, 
the s^d eari of Morton, with divers other nobility and 
gcrit. were declared rebels to your majesty, and banished 
your realm for insolent murder committed in your majes- 
ty's own chamber, which they alledged was done by com- 
mand of your husband, who notwithstanding affirmed that 
he was compelled by them to subscribe the warrant given 
for that effect 5 howsoever the truth of that matter remains 
amongst them, it appertains not to me at this time to be 
curious 5 true it is that I was one of that number, that 
heavily offended against your majesty, and passed in France 
the time of our banishment, at the desire of the rest, ta 
hupibly pray your brother the most christian king, to in- 
tcrcced that our offences might be pardoned, and you^ 
majesty's clemency extended towards us, albeit divers of 
no small reputatioxi, in that realm, was of the opinion, that 
the said fact merited neither to be requisite for, nor yet 
pardoned. Always such was the careful mind of his ma- 
jesty towards the quietness of that realm, that the dealing 
in that cause was committed to Monsieur de Movisir, who 
was directed at that time to go into Scotland, to -congra* 
tulate the happy birth of your son, whom Almighty God 
of his goodness may long preserve in happy estate and per- 
petual felicity 5 the careful travel of the said de Movisir 
^was so effectual, and your majesty's mind so inclined to 
mercy, that within short space thereafter, I was permitted 
to repair in Scotland, to deal with earls Murray, Athol, 
Bodvel, Arguile, and secretary Ledington, in the name

and behalf of the said earl M orton^ lords Reven^ Linsa/^ 
«nd remanent complesis, that they might make offer in 
the names of the said earl, of any matter that might satisfy 
your majesty's wrath, and procure your clemency to be 
extended in their favours ; at my coming to ^hem, after I 
had opened the effect of my message, they declared that 
the marriage betwix you and your husband had been the 
occasion already of great evil in that realm, and if your 
husband should be suffered to follow the appetite and mind 
cf such as was about him, that kind of dealing might pro^ 
duce with time worse effects $ for ielping of such incon-> 
venience that might fall out by that kind of dealing; they 
had thought it convenient to join themselves in league and 
band with son^e other noblemen, resolved to obey yottf 
majesty as their natural sovereign, and have nothing to do 
with your husband's command whatsoever^ if the said earl 
would for himself enter into that band and confederacy 
with them, they could be content to humbly request and 
travel by aU rnean^ with your majesty far his pardon, but 
before they could any farther proceed, they desired to know 
the said earl's mind herein ; when I had answered, that 
he nor his friends, at my departure, could not know that 
any such like matter would be proponit, and therefore was 
not insitructed what to answer therein, they desired that I 
should return sufficiently instructed in this matter to Ster^ 
ling, before the baptism of your son, whom God might 
preserve ; this message was faitlifiilly delivered by me at 
Newcastle in England, where the said carl then remained, 
in presence of his friends and company^ where they all 
condescended to have no farther dealing with your hus- 
ban4f and to enter into the said band* With this deUbe- 
ration I returned to Sterling, where at the request of the 
most chri^ian king and the queen's majesty of England 
by their ambassadors present, your majesty's gracious par*^

don was granted unto them all, undei* condition always thaf 
they should remain banished forth of the realm, the space 
of two years, and farther during your majesty's plea^rey 
which limitation was after mitigated at the humble request 
of your own nobility, so that immediately after the said 
carl of Morton repaired into Scotland to Quhittingaime, 
where the earl Bodvell and secretary Ledington come to 
him;' what speech passed there amongst them, as God 
shall be my judge, I knew nothing at that time, but at 
their departure I was requested by the said earl Morton to - 
accompany the earl Bodvell and secretary to Edenburghj 
and to return with such answer as they slaould obtain of 
your majesty, which being given to me by the said persons, 
as God shall be my judge, was no other than these words, 
** Schaw to the earl Morton that the queen will hear no 
speech of that matter appointed unto him ;" when I crafit 
that the answer might be made more sensible, secretary 
Ledington said, that the earl would sufficiently understand 
it, albeit, few or none at that time understand what passed 
amongst them. It is known to all men, als vcill be railling 
letters past betwixt the said earl and lidington when they 
become in divers factions, as also ane buck sett fiirth by the 
ministers, wherein they affirm that the earl of Morton has 
ccttifessed to them, before his death, that the earl Bodvell 
come to Quhittingaime to propon the calling away off the 
king your husband, to the which proposition the said earl 
of Morton affirms that he could give no answer unto such 
time he might know your majesty's mind therein, which 
he never received. As to the abominable murder, it is 
known too by the depositions of many persons that were 
executed to the death for the committing thereof, that 
the same was executed by them, and at the command of 
such of the nobility, as had subscrivit band for that effect : •

APPENDIX. 33S: 

to yourself, and the remainder may be understood by the 
aforesaid witnesses that was examined in torture, and that 
are extant in the custody of the ordinary judges in Scot- 
land, my innocency so far as may concern any fact doea 
appear sufficiently to your majesty. And as for my deal- 
ing aforasaid, I can be no otherwise charged therein, but as 
what would accuse the vessel that preserves the vine from, 
harm, for the intemperancy of such as immoderately use 
the same. As for the special cause of my banishment, I 
think the same has proceeded upon ane opinion conceived, 
that I was able to accuse the earl of Morton of so much 
matter as they alledge himself to have confessed before he 
died, and would not be induced, for loss of reputation, to 
perform any part thereof. If this be the occasion of my 
trouble, as I suppose it is, what punishment I should de- 
serve, I remit me to your majesty's better judgment, who 
well knows how careful ever ilk gentleman should be of 
his fame, reputatioUy and honour, and how far ever ilk man 
should "abhor the name of a pultroun, and how indecent it 
would have been to me to accuse the earl of Morton, being 
so near of his kin, notwithstanding all the injuries I was 
constrained to receive at his hand all the time of his go- 
vernment, and for no other cause, but for shewing of par- 
ticular friendship to particular friends in the time of the 
last cruel troubles in Scotland. Sorry I be now to accuse 
him in any matter being dead, and more sorry that being 
on lyff, be such kind of dealing obtained that name of 
Ingrate. Always for my own part I have been banished 
my native country those three years and four months, li^ 
ing in anxiety of mind, my hoU guds in Scotland, which 
were not small, intermittit and disponit upon, and has con- 
tinually since the time I was relieved out of my last troubles 
at the desire of Monsieur de Movisir, attended to know 
your majesty's pleasure, and to await upon what service it

I AM satisfiqd mysdf that Huntley and Archibald Dou- 
glas were both present, but not at the explosion. Binning, 
Douglases servant, was tried and executed the day after 
Morton's execution, and according to an imperfect abstract 
of his deposition, he declared " that his master passed to 
the ddd doing, the said Binning and Gairner his servants 
being with him in company," (Arnot's Crim. Trials, i6.) 
<< and tint ane of his mules in talking j and efter his in« 
cuming that night changit his claithis quhilkis war full of 
day and foulness, and he beand send to Throplowis wynde

not, but as he supponithe thocht he knew the voice of Mr. 
James Balfouris brother, proveist of the Chairterhousc. 
In the meantymc came in Mr. John Maitland, abot of 
Coldinghame, and putting his tow handis on his awn 
mouth, maid to him an signe to keip quiet the rest of his 
mynd." Aaierson^s MSS. When Binning's evidence wa« 
produced against Archibald Douglas on his collusive trial, 
he objected to its inconsistencies ; that in one part, after 
supping in his chamber, he went out at the back door with 
his two servants, to the deid doing : in another part of the 
same deposition. Binning had gone to bed, in his own 
house, when the explosion took place, and returning oo 
the noise, found his master reading in bed ; that he fol<- 
lowed him next day to the court, in vacation, when the ses- 
sion ' was not sitting, and when Douglas was not then pro- 
nioted to the bench; and that the road from the chamber to 
the Kirk of Field, was by no means fit for a man armed in

sic a deid.'^ But the contradlctionsi of which Douglas 
availed himself, confirm the fact. After supper, at six in 
the evening, he passed with two servants, according to 
agreement, in his secret armour to meet BothwcU in the 
Cowgate, and was one of the three whom Powrie, on the 
hst carriage of the powder to the Black Friars gate, de- 
scribes, in his second examination, as attending Bothwell 
with cloaks about their faces and mules upon their feet. 
Hay of Talla walked with Bothwell up and down the 
Cowgate, while the powder was bringing, but that part 
of his evidence in which he blotted Huntley, was sup* 
pressed in his deposition 5 and as Argyle and Huntley had 
passed with the queen to the king's chamber, it is most 
likely that one or other returned to Bothwell in the Cow- 
gate before the powder arrived. On Douglas's return home, 
when Binning was sent to (a house in) Thropstows Winde- 
foot, he met certane mussilit men, or others of the conspi- 
rators whom Bothwell had dimissed, one of whom he per- 
ceived to be Sir James Balfour's brother, sent to the deid 
doing, and the abbot of Coldingham (Lethington's brother 
sent on the same purpose) coming in, gave him a sign 
to be silent ; evidendy before the explosion took place. 
Douglas afterwards retired to bed, like Ormiston, that no 
man might say he was at the deid doing j and his servant 
returning upon the report of the powder, found him reading 
in bed, and followed him next day to the Tolbooth, not to 
the court of session, but to the justice general's inquisition 
into the murder. The velvet mules were high soled or 
embroidered slippers, worn by men and women :

iThe dt^y scat-penis (escarpins, thin ptiiiips) indicate that 
tnules were worn like clogs, above the shoe, (see Vigneul- 
Marville's Melanges d'Histoire, &c.i, 205.) and the emlwroid- 
cred mules worn by courtiers, which, with their cloaks, dis^ 
tiilguished Huntley, Argyle, and Douglas from peasants^ 
were easily discerned by Powrie, from the reflexion of the 
lighted- candle within the gate. I conclude therefore that 
Huntley and Douglas wefe present, when tile powder was 
brought to the Blackfriars gate ; and, as the latter inform- 
ed Morton that he came With Huntley and Bothwell to 
the Kirk of Field yard, that he was dismissed there, on 
their return to the qiieen, as Huntley was afterwards dis^ 
missed by Bothwell at tnidnight, on his i'etum from the 
palace. Paris*s Second Confession^ As the powder was 
then introduced, Douglas informed Morton that he wa^ 
present, not imagining that Bothwell attended farther to 
the deid doing ; but Morton naturally imagined, that he 
returned with Huntley and Bothwell from the abbey, bi- 
fore the explosion took place*
