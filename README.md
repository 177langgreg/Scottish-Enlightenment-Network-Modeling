# Network Modeling with NLP Analysis of Historical Texts
This repository provides code to support the academic paper titled "NLP Analysis of the Enlightnment in Scotland: An Interdisciplinary Project". The network model created here represents the relationships between texts in a corpus of written works from the Enlightenment period in and around Scotland.

Information to navigate the documents in this repository:
- The file "Base Text Files" includes the files gathered from online sources which represent the original texts. Minor changes were made to clean the source text files including deleting portions of text added by digital libraries which may have influenced the NLP measure of similarity.
- The file "Processed Text Files" includes versions of the text files which now are revised by the data pr-processing. Steps in the pre-processing include removing numbers, punctuation, and capitalization, and "stemming" of words to associate words with common roots.
- The file "Combined Analysis.v2" provides the code, which was run in Google Colab, which was used for the Data Processing, Similarity Modeling, and Network Modeling.
