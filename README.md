# Network Modeling with NLP Analysis of Historical Texts
This repository provides code to support the academic paper titled "NLP Analysis of the Enlightnment in Scotland: An Interdisciplinary Project". The network model created here represents the relationships between texts in a corpus of written works from the Enlightenment period in and around Scotland.

Information to navigate the documents in this repository:
- The folder "Processed Text Files" includes versions of the text files which now are revised by the data pre-processing. Steps in the pre-processing include removing numbers, punctuation, and capitalization, and "stemming" of words to associate words with common roots.
- The file "Combined Analysis" provides the code, which was run in Google Colab, used for the Data Processing, Similarity Modeling, and Network Modeling.
